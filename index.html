In order to elucidate the structure and function of any protein it is first necessary to purify it. Protein purification techniques have evolved over the past ten years with improvements in equipment control, automation, and separation materials, and the introduction of new techniques such as affinity membranes and expanded beds. These developments have reduced the workload involved in protein purification, but there is still a need to consider how unit operations linked together to form a purification strategy, which can be scaled up if necessary. The two Practical Approach books on protein purification have therefore been thoroughly updated and rewritten where necessary. The core of both books is the provision of detailed practical guidelines aimed particularly at laboratory scale purification. Information on scale-up considerations is given where appropriate. The books are not comprehensive but do cover the major laboratory techniques and common sources of protein. <em>Protein Purification Techniques</em> focuses on unit operations and analytical techniques. It starts with an overview of purification strategy and then covers initial extraction and clarification techniques. The rest of the book concentrates on different purification methods with the emphasis being on chromatography. The final chapter considers general scale-up considerations. <em>Protein Purification Applications</em> describes purification strategies from common sources: mammalian cell culture, microbial cell culture, milk, animal tissue, and plant tissue. It also includes chapters on purification of inclusion bodies, fusion proteins, and purification for crystallography. A purification strategy that can produce a highly pure single protein from a crude mixture of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and cell debris to is a work of art to be admired. These books (available individually or as a set)are designed to give the laboratory worker the information needed to undertake the challenge of designing such a strategy.<br></p><p>Simon Roe is at AEA Technology Products and Systems, Biosciences, Harwell.</p><h2>Commercial Leasing: A Transactional Primer</h2><p>This book is the first among legal textbooks to examine a crucial component of real property practice: commercial lease law. Commercial leasing is the lifeblood of commercial real property development in the United States. Real property lawyers regularly represent landlords, tenants and lenders in the leasing of commercial space. This is true in periods of booming real estate development, as well as in periods of economic downturn. Leasing practice is transactional and centers on a single negotiated document the commercial lease. By the end of a course based on this book, students will have developed a genuine understanding of the major terms of the commercial office lease, the goals and objectives of parties to the transaction, and the skills crucial to effective representation. Bogart and Hammond have crafted a book uniquely suited to teaching this important area of practice. The book utilizes a sophisticated commercial office lease form promulgated by the ABA. Each chapter focuses on a particular lease provision. Chapters pull apart contractual language and terms of art, reveal the motivations of the parties to the deal, and finally, examine the underlying substantive law. In addition to presenting interesting case opinions, each chapter provides numerous challenging, real-world problems. Chapters typically conclude by asking students to apply what they have learned to provisions taken from the much-publicized &#39;&#39;Killer Lease.&#39;&#39; The book includes a chapter explicitly discussing professionalism, ethics and negotiations, and contains drafting and negotiation exercises that force students to pull together skills and substantive law lessons. This second edition also includes new problems patterned on authentic leasing practice as well as recent important cases. In much the same way that real estate lawyers confronted newly developed environmental law a generation ago, real estate lawyers today are learning how to meet client demands that leaseholds and leasehold contracting satisfy standards of resource sustainability. This new edition therefore includes a chapter on &#39;&#39;Green Leasing.&#39;&#39; Real estate, property, and transactional law professors who want to help students to develop a real understanding of a transactions-based practice will enjoy Commercial Leasing. This book will form the basis of an exciting elective real estate transactions course.</p><p>Daniel Bogart is a Professor of Law and Director of the Law Resources Center at Chapman University School of Law.

From the very beginning of human history, materials have been taken from the natural world and shaped, modified, and adapted for everything from primitive tools to modern electronics. This renowned book by noted materials engineering author Mike Ashby and industrial designer Kara Johnson explores the role of materials and materials processing in product design, with a particular emphasis on creating both desired aesthetics and functionality. The new edition features even more of the highly useful "materials profiles" that give critical design, processing, performance and applications criteria for each material in question. The reader will find information ranging from the generic and commercial names of each material, its physical and mechanical properties, its chemical properties, its common uses, how it is typically made and processed, and even its average price. And with improved photographs and drawings, the reader is taken even more closely to the way real design is done by real designers, selecting the optimum materials for a successful product.<ul><li>The best guide ever published on the on the role of materials, past and present, in product development, by noted materials authority Mike Ashby and professional designer Kara Johnson--now with even better photos and drawings on the Design Process</li><li>Significant new section on the use of re-cycled materials in products, and the importance of sustainable design for manufactured goods and services</li><li>Enhanced materials profiles, with addition of new materials types like nanomaterials, advanced plastics and bio-based materials</li></ul></p><p>Royal Society Research Professor Emeritus at Cambridge University and Former Visiting Professor of Design at the Royal College of Art, London, UK<p></p><p>Mike Ashby is sole or lead author of several of Elsevier&#x2019;s top selling engineering textbooks, including Materials and Design: The Art and Science of Material Selection in Product Design, Materials Selection in Mechanical Design, Materials and the Environment, and Materials: Engineering, Science, Processing and Design.

By sharing all income and resources equally among its members, the kibbutz system created strong incentives to free ride or&#x2015;as in the case of the most educated and skilled&#x2015;to depart for the city. Yet for much of the twentieth century kibbutzim thrived, and kibbutz life was perceived as idyllic both by members and the outside world. In <i>The Mystery of the Kibbutz</i>, Ran Abramitzky blends economic perspectives with personal insights to examine how kibbutzim successfully maintained equal sharing for so long despite their inherent incentive problems.</p><p>Weaving the story of his own family&#x2019;s experiences as kibbutz members with extensive economic and historical data, Abramitzky sheds light on the idealism and historic circumstances that helped kibbutzim overcome their economic contradictions. He illuminates how the design of kibbutzim met the challenges of thriving as enclaves in a capitalist world and evaluates kibbutzim&#x2019;s success at sustaining economic equality. By drawing on extensive historical data and the stories of his pioneering grandmother who founded a kibbutz, his uncle who remained in a kibbutz his entire adult life, and his mother who was raised in and left the kibbutz, Abramitzky brings to life the rise and fall of the kibbutz movement.</p><p>The lessons that <i>The Mystery of the Kibbutz</i> draws from this unique social experiment extend far beyond the kibbutz gates, serving as a guide to societies that strive to foster economic and social equality.</p></p><p><p>"Can egalitarian and voluntary communities thrive within a capitalist society? Bringing together social sciences and modern economic tools, this book provides a fascinating and rich analysis of the Israeli kibbutz experience."<b>--Emmanuel Saez, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><p>"Ran Abramitzky has written a fascinating, important book infused with both deep personal insight and incisive economic analysis. I predict it will be a lasting contribution to the literature on the kibbutz movement."<b>--Al Roth, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics</b></p><p>"<i>The Mystery of the Kibbutz</i> is a brilliant economic analysis of how individuals' equality in income and consumption in a collective-production society could survive but eventually collapse.

Miller, <i>Christianity Today</i> <br><br>&#x201c;Microhistory at its best.&#x201d;&#x2014;Larissa Taylor, <i>Renaissance Quarterly</i> <br></p><p><i>The Burdens of Sister Margaret</i> by Craig Harline is based on a trove of letters written by a 17th-century nun in a convent called Bethlehem in the city of Leuven (part of modern Belgium). Her fears of demonic possession, complaints of sexual harassment, and suspicion of conspiracies against her among the other sisters led to her being twice banished from the convent. Set against the dramatic background of the early Reformation, <i>The Burdens of Sister Margaret</i> describes not only the daily lives of a community of nuns, but also the impact of the major events of the early Reformation on ordinary clergy and laity. Like Harline's extraordinary <i>A Bishop's Tale</i>, this book describes the grand sweep of history through the perspective of particular people in a particular place. Thus, readers are given a strong general orientation to the abiding tensions of Catholic religious orders ("special friendships versus common love, dissent versus obedience, the rights of the individual versus the demands of the community, distinguishing between temporal needs and extravagance, and maintaining separation from the world while living within it"). And readers also discover a wealth of concrete and compelling detail about the wily machinations of lives lived behind convent walls. (The book's first section, "How Just About Everyone Came to Loathe Sister Margaret," will frighten, tickle, and fascinate.) <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>This abridged version is complemented by a web-site which contains many of the letters written by Sister Margaret and other nuns of her convent (all translated by the author), as well as excerpts from the book.</p><h2>The Knowledge Deficit: Closing the Shocking Education Gap for American Children</h2><p>Hirsch shows why American students perform less well than students in other industrialized countries. Drawing on classroom observation, the history of ideas, and current scientific understanding of the patterns of intellectual growth, he builds the case that our schools have indeed made progress in teaching the mechanics of reading, but do not convey the more complex and essential content needed for reading comprehension. Hirsch reasons that literacy depends less on formal reading &#39;skills&#39; and more on exposure to rich knowledge. His argument gives parents specific tools for enhancing their child&#39;s ability to read with comprehension; shows how No-Child-Left-Behind tests and SATs are measuring a kind of knowledge that is not being taught in our schools; and maps out how American schools can become a strong antidote to poverty and to the race-based achievement gap, and thus fulfill our democratic ideal for our children.--From publisher description.Provides an analysis of the state of modern American education to trace a link between a lack of reading comprehension and poor performance and furnishes specific tools for parents to enhance a child&#39;s ability to read with comprehension.</p><p>E.D. Hirsch, Jr. is the Linden Kent Memorial Professor of English at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, and the author of Cultural Literacy, The First Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, and The Core Knowledge Series. Dr. Hirsch is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and has been a senior fellow of the National Endowment for the Humanities. He is president of the Core Knowledge Foundation, a nonprofit organization devoted to educational reform.The notion of learning how to learn is a shibboleth in America's schools, but it distorts reading instruction, contends this provocative manifesto. Education theorist Hirsch decries a dominant "Romantic" pedagogy that disparages factual knowledge and emphasizes reading comprehension "strategies"&#x2014;summarizing, identifying themes, drawing inferences&#x2014;that children can deploy on any text. Such formal skills, he argues, are easily acquired; what kids really need is a broad background knowledge of history, science and culture to help them assimilate new vocabulary and understand more advanced readings. "Process-oriented" methods that apply reading comprehension drills to "vapid" texts waste time and slow kids' progress, Hirsch contends, and should be replaced with a more traditional, "knowledge-oriented" academic approach with a rich factual content. Hirsch repeats the call for a standard curriculum based on a canon of general knowledge (he touts his own core knowledge sequence as a model) made in his bestselling <i>Cultural Literacy</i>. That work drew fire from multiculturalists who accused Hirsch of promoting dead-white-male worship, but here he grounds his case in the latest cognitive-science research (with a healthy dose of common sense). Fluently written and accessible to teachers and parents alike, the book presents a challenge to reigning educational orthodoxies. <i>(Apr. 24)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He argues that the traditional symbolic actions and legal rituals through which European sovereignty was asserted were strained to the breaking point by the unprecedented nature of the discovery of the New World. But the book also shows that the experience of the marvelous is not necessarily an agent of empire: in writers as different as Herodotus, Jean de L�ry, and Montaigne&#x2014;and notably in <i>Mandeville's Travels,</i> the most popular travel book of the Middle Ages&#x2014;wonder is a sign of a remarkably tolerant recognition of cultural difference.<br><br><i>Marvelous Possession</i> is not only a collection of the odd and exotic through which Stephen Greenblatt powerfully conveys a sense of the marvelous, but also a highly original extension of his thinking on a subject that has occupied him throughout his career. The book reaches back to the ancient Greeks and forward to the present to ask how it is possible, in a time of disorientation, hatred of the other, and possessiveness, to keep the capacity for wonder from being poisoned?<br><br>"A marvellous book.

Powell is professor emeritus of history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His many books include <i>North Carolina through Four Centuries</i>, which won the 1989 Mayflower Cup for Nonfiction.Designed as a textbook for use in North Carolina history classes, this is a useful one-volume history of the state. But there are flaws. The style is standard textbook English, making for rather dull reading. Arts and literature receive only about three pages of text, leaving the impression the state has been a vast cultural wasteland for 400 years. The emphasis is on the positive, e.g., lynching is dismissed as "an unfortunate blot on the record of North Carolina." Though nothing new is added to the interpretation of the state's history, this book will no doubt become the standard state history due to its attempted comprehensiveness. Certainly no North Carolina library will wish to be without a copy.<br><i>- Melvin L.

Now it's your turn to learn how to construct a portfolio that is sure to outperform the market averages, as well as almost every professional money manager in the world. Warren Buffett's method of predictability can determine a future target price, which in turn determines his all-important purchase price. However, Buffett doesn't draw conclusions of his predictability method relative to the future total returns of portfolios.

It would be just as effective to pick stocks by blindly throwing darts! That's why, when a successful investor like Warren Buffett comes along, the world takes notice. Buffett is known as one of the most successful investors in history. In <i>Buffett and Beyond, Second Edition</i>, his simple strategy is revealed so that any investor can replicate it. This book also goes one step beyond Buffett's approach, demonstrating a proven method for predicting the future success of portfolio positions. This book walks readers through the step-by-step process of improving the odds by building solid growth portfolios as well as dividend growth and income strategies.</p> <p>Buffett is famous for his long-term approach to investments, and this book reinforces the strategy that has worked so well for the Berkshire Hathaway chairman. But few people know that the method used by Buffett is the real foundation of his success. Clean Surplus Accounting, explained in depth in <i>Buffett and Beyond</i>, structures the calculations that let investors discover a very unique Return on Owner's Equity (ROE). This simple accounting method is powerful enough to beat out even the most complex systems used on Wall Street in terms of both income and growth. This book, along with the videos available on the companion website, allows readers to make decisions using the same guidelines Warren Buffett uses every day.</p> <p><i>Buffett and Beyond</i> contains no magic, no jargon, and no passing fads. Instead, it shows investors an approach that has been working for over half a century. This book even takes Buffett's strategy one step further to take the guesswork out of portfolio building. Knowing when an investment will yield predictable long-term returns&#x2014;and when it won't&#x2014;is within the reach of any individual investor using the Clean Surplus Accounting method. This method expands on what Buffett has taught us and provides a solid framework for ensuring investment stability and income far into the future.</p><p>LEARN THIS PROVEN METHOD TO BUILD GROWTH AND INCOME PORTFOLIOS THAT OUTPERFORM THE PROS</p> <p>Why reinvent the wheel? Warren Buffett has been using a simple strategy to achieve long-term investment success for over half a century. <i>Buffett and Beyond</i> reveals this easy to understand strategy and expands on Buffett's ideas to give you a portfolio-building technique that will outperform 96% of professional money managers over the long run.</p> <p>The method is simple. Using Clean Surplus Accounting to calculate a unique Return on Owners' Equity (ROE), which is totally different than the traditional accounting ROE that you learned about in school, you can easily locate firms with the fastest and most consistent growth patterns. In <i>Buffett and Beyond</i>, you'll see the evidence for yourself: from 1987 to the present, portfolios focusing on above-average Clean Surplus ROEs have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 average over every economic cycle. Best of all, this method even allows you to predict the long-term future success of portfolio positions&#x2015;taking Buffett's approach to the next level.</p> <p>Complete with access to a companion website featuring tutorial videos, PowerPoint slides, computer software, and other resources, <i>Buffett and Beyond</i> is a quick read that will help you easily turn your portfolios into stable sources of long-term value.</p></p><h2>Understanding the Infinite</h2><p>How can the infinite, a subject so remote from our finite experience, be an everyday working tool for the working mathematician? Blending history, philosophy, mathematics and logic, Shaughan Lavine answers this question with clarity. An account of the origins of the modern mathematical theory of the infinite, his book is also a defense against the attacks and misconceptions that have dogged this theory since its introduction in the late 19th century. With his development of set theory in the 1880s, Georg Cantor introduced the infinite into mathematics. But his theory, both critics and supporters have charged, was subject to paradoxes proceeding from Cantor&#39;s &#34;naive intuitions&#34;, and this verdict has had an enormous impact on the philosophy of mathematics. Lavine effectively reverses this charge by showing that set theory is in fact an excellent example of the posititve and necessary role of intuition in mathematics. His history, moving from Greek geometry through the development of calculus to the evolution of set theory, ultimately leads to the crux of the issue: the source of our intuitions concerning the infinite. Along the way, he offers a careful and critical discussion of differing views across the philosophical spectrum. Making use of the mathematical work of Jan Mycielski, formerly accessible only to logicians, Lavine demonstrates that knowledge of the infinite is possible, even according to strict standards that require some intuitive basis for knowledge. He shows that the source of our intuitions concerning Cantor&#39;s infinite, as a matter of historical and psychological fact, is extrapolation from ordinary experience of the indefinitely large.</p><p>An engaging account of the origins of the modern mathematical theory of the infinite, his book is also a spirited defense against the attacks and misconceptions that have dogged this theory since its introduction in the late nineteenth century.Shaughan Lavine is Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Arizona.</p><h2>Mencken and Sara: A Life in Letters : The Private Correspondence of H.L.

The first nine chapters deal with bonding, structure, and the physical and chemical properties that are influenced mostly by the type of bonding rather than the microstructure, such as defect structure and the atomic and electronic transport in ceramics. The next set of chapters deal with properties that are more microstructure-dependent, such as fracture toughness, optical, magnetic, and dielectric properties. A separate chapter deals with the science of sintering and microstructural development.

It combines a child-centered philosophy with problem-solving strategies, and provides a thorough discussion of gender role stereotyping and multicultural issues in childcare. The philosophy of caregiving that underlies this book comes from Magda Gerber and Tom Forrest, M.D., as well as the earlier work of Emmi Pikler. These pioneers of the field stressed the need to integrate (1) knowledge of play as curriculum, (2) concepts of child development with caregiving, (3) the physical and social environment, and (4) adult relations.</p><p>Janet Gonzalez-Mena started her early childhood career in a cooperative preschool as a parent volunteer back in 1966. She then became a Head Start volunteer and ended up as a teacher in a preschool for Spanish-speaking children and their families in 1970&#x2019;s. She has also helped open several pilot programs including a therapeutic child care program and a home-based bilingual preschool program. When Magda Gerber came into her life in the mid-1970&#x2019;s, Janet signed up for an internship with her at the Children&#x2019;s Health Council in Menlo Park, California. As a result of that experience, later, when she became a child care director, she was able to incorporate much of what she learned into her work and was influential in expanding that program to include an infant center. Training and teaching adults has always been sideline, even when she was working with children and families. She worked as a Head Start trainer and as adjunct faculty in 4 community colleges plus the University of California Santa Cruz credential extension program. She taught for 15 years as full time faculty at Napa Valley College in the Child and Family Studies Program. Since 1991, she has been part of the faculty for WestEd&#x2019;s Program for Infant-Toddler Caregivers (PITC) Training of Trainer Institutes. Janet has been writing along with teaching for all these years and is author of numerous articles and 13 books related to early childhood, including Foundations of Early Childhood Education; Infants, Toddlers, and Caregivers (with co-author Dianne Eyer); and Diversity in Early Care and Education: Honoring Differences (Formerly Multicultural Issues in Child Care). She wrote Dragon Mom about herself as parent to help early childhood professionals alleviate guilt when their parenting doesn't live up to their high standards. Her latest passion is understanding more about the Pikler Institute in Budapest, Hungary, where Magda Gerber came from. It took her 30 years to get there after she first heard of it, but her first trip to it in November of 2003 merely whetted her appetite. She has made two more since and is planning for another one. She is fascinated by the approach and is convinced that this residential nursery is a model for the world. She is continuing to learn more about how this approach can be used to improve infant-toddler care and education programs in the United States. She is also working with a group in Mexico to explore how the approach might fit into their models of residential care for infants and toddlers. Janet has a Master of Arts Degree in Human Development from Pacific Oaks in Pasadena, California.</p><h2>A Map of Misreading</h2><p>Illustrates a critical technique for uncovering literary relationships and poetic influences among various poets through interpretations of such writers as Browning, Whitman, and Dickinson</p><p>Harold Bloom is Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University and Berg Professor of English at New York University."In the field of literary criticism the most potentially influential book published in the last twelve months is surely Harold Bloom's A Map of Misreading"--Margaret Wimsatt, Commonweal<br><br>"The sincerity of this book...the sheer care for poetry which governs both this work and its predecessor, is unmistakable and most impressive."--Michael Wood, The New York Review of Books<br><br>"An exceptionally subtle and complex work."--Kenneth Burke, The New Republic<br><br>"Bloom is the most rare of critics.

Inspired by her example, Beha vows to read the entire Five-Foot Shelf, one volume a week, over the course of the next year. As he passes from St. Augustine&#x2019;s Confessions to Don Quixote, from Richard Henry Dana&#x2019;s Two Years Before the Mast to essays by Cicero, Emerson, and Thoreau, he takes solace in the realization that many of the authors are grappling with the same questions he faces: What is the purpose of life? How do we live a good life? What can the wisdom of the past teach us about our own challenges? Beha&#x2019;s chronicle is a smart, big-hearted, and inspirational mix of memoir and intellectual excursion&#x2014;and a powerful testament to what great books can teach us about how to live our own lives.</p><p>No Bio<br><br>No Bio<br> In much wisdom is much grief,&#x2019; counsels the book of Ecclesiastes, and in Christopher R. Beha&#x2019;s tender intellectual memoir [of reading the Harvard Classics], we find plenty of both. . . . Life intruded rudely on Beha&#x2019;s sabbatical, and he rose to the occasion by writing an unexpected narrative that deftly reconciles lofty thoughts and earthy pain. In doing so, he makes an elegant case for literature as an everyday companion no less valuable than the iPod.&#x201d; New York Times Book Review<br><br> Winning . . . Intensely felt . . . Beha is shtick-free and serious of mind . . . Without making grandiose claims, this book serves as a guide to today&#x2019;s perplexed, reflexively ironic reader, an inducement to think seriously without apologizing and feel deeply without hedging. . . . It demonstrates how and why to read seriously.&#x201d; San Francisco Chronicle<br><br> An elegant and honest memoir . . . A charming addition to the literature of books about books. Beha is a clear-sighted writer, who has accomplished exactly what Eliot would have wanted: He found repose and strength of mind in those who express things more elegantly than we, in our Twittering, blog-filled age, ever can.&#x201d; Bookforum<br><br> Disarming . . . Beha&#x2019;s utter humility and unpretentious tone while describing an inherently academic and potentially irrelevant goal to read a jumble of old-timey books and essays puts the reader immediately at ease. Beha has a nice, unaffected way of including his internal monologues and the lessons he learns over the course of the year, as he struggles with his need to connect with the past and get perspective on his life. . . . What starts out as a mission to keep from being lost, adrift and alone in his sickness, ends with Beha finding solace. The Whole Five Feet reads like a charming college syllabus, written by a warm-hearted professor, who through a mutual love of books has inexplicably become one of your closest friends and confidants.&#x201d; The Portland Mercury<br><br> [In the Harvard Classics, Beha] finds comfort in the fact that these writers faced the same dilemmas, pains and sources of hope he finds today. The result is a thought-provoking, tender, compelling read that is part memoir, part ode to the power of great books.&#x201d; The Oregonian<br><br>"The Whole Five Feet is no book report; Beha&#x2019;s reflections are far the richer because he delicately wheels and dives among both the great writers&#x2019; ideas and his own life experiences proving, if we needed proof, of the greatness and centrality of reading. About John Stuart Mill, Beha reflects on the nature of pleasure and happiness, observing through the prism of his own illnesses, 'Your comfort, especially your physical comfort, isn&#x2019;t under your control, so you&#x2019;d better find something else to work at.' The idea here is mature far beyond his years, and yet the style is all salt spray and blue sky."

Stunning color images by award-winning photographer Gediyon Kifle bring the breadth of the African experience to life, from fishermen at sunset off the coast of Zanzibar to French baguettes loaded onto a bicycle in Senegal.</p><p>Marcus shares more than 200 enticing recipes, including his own African-inspired creations and traditional dishes from all parts of Africa. You can delight in spicy stews and Barbequed Snapper from West Africa and the familiar Mediterranean flavors of dishes like Moroccan Lemon-Olive Chicken, or make your way east and south for the irresistible taste combinations of dishes such as Curried Trout with Coconut-Chili Sauce from Kenya and Apple-Squash Fritters from South Africa's Cape Malay. Using ingredients that are readily available in American markets, the recipes are doable as well as delicious.</p><p>Of course, one of the keys to authentic African cooking is the use of spice blends and rubs, which elevate simple cooking techniques to an excitingly varied and intense level. Marcus includes his favorites here, with blends that go from sweet to spicy and feature everything from hot chili peppers and peppermint leaves to sesame seeds and ginger.</p><p>As he says, Africa is "a state of mind that I hope this book will help you tap into wherever you are."

Is it a thing with a hairy face, webbed fingers, and green skin? Or is it simply anything we don't understand? An art book for and about the curious, <i>Special Cases</i> explores humanity's age-old obsession with mythical and literal monstrosity in a way that is not for the faint-hearted. Using photographs she has taken at natural history and anatomical museums, models of her own creation, and artwork from numerous private and public collections, celebrated photographer Rosamond W. Purcell delightedly delves into squeamish subjects such as dwarves, giants, conjoined twins, hairy people, albinos, and humans with animal heads. Sure to capture the imagination of artists, historians, and anyone with a taste for the perverse, <i>Special Cases</i> is a clever visual history whose pages and pictures reveal the fiipside of what we call normal.</p><p>Rosamond W. Purcell has had her photographs published in numerous books and journals throughout the world, including the Sciences, where she collaborates monthly with Stephen J. Gould. This book was inspired by the exhibition Special Cases: Natural AnomaliUnder the guise of cultural studies, humankind's ceaseless fascination with human anomalies has gained a newfound legitimacy, and publishers are producing ever more works to satisfy both the prurient and intellectual ends of the scale. This handsomely produced book, unfortunately, seems unsure about where to place its focus and, ultimately, will disappoint most readers. Purcell, a photographer, writer, and curator of a show at the Getty Research Institute, from which this book was derived, has written a rambling, unconstructed text that not infrequently touches on fascinating ideas and historical examples. But just as often she abandons a theme just as she gets beneath the surface or moves on to another sample before fully examining the specimen before us. Her thesis?that the collectors and classifiers play as much a role in creating a freak as do the abnormalities?is interesting, if not entirely new, but never truly develops. Recommended only for academic cultural studies collections; popular collections would do better with Lawrence Weschler's Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder (LJ 10/1/95) and Jan Bondeson's A Cabinet of Medical Curiosities (LJ 10/15/97).?Douglas McClemont, New York<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Memoir and Remains of R.M. M&#39;Cheyne</h2><p>Few books have been better loved than the Memoir and Remains of Robert Murray M&#39;Cheyne. Its circulation underlines this. First published in 1844, within twenty-five years it went through one hundred and sixteen English editions. In 1910 it was estimated that, including translations into other languages, not less than half a million copies were in circulation. Few books have had such a widespread influence on the lives of God&#39;s people. Testimonies to its usefulness were received from many lands and Christians of differing theological persuasions have testified to the blessing experiences through reading it. &#39;This is one of the best and most profitable volumes ever published&#39;, said C.H. Spurgeon. &#39;The memoir of such a man ought surely to be in the hands of every Christian and certainly every preacher of the Gospel.&#39; Few books contain such variety and welath of spiritual matter between their covers. As well as the life covering 174 pages, the work contains a good selection of letters, sermons, other writings and sacred songs.</p><p></p><h2>The Letters of the Republic: Publication and the Public Sphere in Eighteenth-Century America</h2><p>The subject of Michael Warner&#x2019;s book is the rise of a nation. America, he shows, became a nation by developing a new kind of reading public, where one becomes a citizen by taking one&#x2019;s place as writer or reader. At heart, the United States is a republic of letters, and its birth can be dated from changes in the culture of printing in the early eighteenth century. The new and widespread use of print media transformed the relations between people and power in a way that set in motion the republican structure of government we have inherited. Examining books, pamphlets, and circulars, he merges theory and concrete analysis to provide a multilayered view of American cultural development.</p><p>Michael Warner is Seymour H. Knox Professor of English and American Studies at Yale University. He is the editor of American Sermons: The Pilgrims to Martin Luther King and Fear of a Queer Planet. He also writes for The Nation, The Advocate, The Village Voice, and other periodicals.&#x201c;Arguing the inseparableness of print and culture, this is one of the most engaging books about eighteenth-century American publishing in decades.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Hazel Dicken-Garcia</b><b>, </b><b><i>Journal of the Early Republic</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Michael Warner&#x2019;s compact discourse on the meaning of the printed word in eighteenth-century America will be recognized by every reader as an extraordinarily ingenious contribution, and one of lasting lasting importance, to the study of republicanism and to the history of print... Warner&#x2019;s notion of a socially and culturally limited &#x2018;public sphere,&#x2019; inhabited by participants in a depersonalized, largely printed discourse, not only rings true to the evidence but provides a powerful aid in articulating the nature and limits of republicanism.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Charles E. Clark</b><b>, </b><b><i>William &amp; Mary Quarterly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Michael Warner captures better than anyone else I know the way a new technology and the practices related to it can enable a new social formation to crystallize.

Practical, practical, practical!<br> --Rita McGlone, assistant director of executive education, The Wharton School of Business<br> Experts now acknowledge that emotional intelligence (EI) is perhaps the most crucial determinant of success in the workplace. And unlike IQ or other traditional measures of intelligence, EI can be developed and dramatically increased. This unprecedented book demonstrates how to master the core competencies of EI, abilities that include self-motivation, high self-awareness, mood management, and emotional mentoring. In addition, it includes scores of real-world examples and dozens of practical exercises that accelerate the process, along with step-by-step approaches to mastering a variety of EI techniques.</p><p><i>Emotional Intelligence at Work</i> is your antidote to job related stress. It is healthy and nutritious for your mind and your body.If you think analytical skills, company loyalty, or even competence is the key to success in the workplace, it&#39;s time to think again. Most experts now agree that those who climb the corporate ladder most quickly are those who possess a high degree of emotional intelligence. Simply put, emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to make your emotions work for you by using them in ways that produce the results you want. And the good news is that, unlike IQ and other traditional measures of intelligence, EI can be developed and dramatically increased.Based on an extensive body of research and the author&#39;s years of experience in the field, Emotional Intelligence at Work is a hands-on guide people can use to amplify their own emotional intelligence. In plain, easy-to-follow language, Dr. Weisinger explains exactly what EI is all about. He shows how to master the core competencies of emotional intelligence, abilities that include self-motivation, high self-awareness, mood management, and emotional mentoring. Moreover, he includes scores of real-world examples and dozens of practical exercises that accelerate the process, as well as step-by-step approaches to mastering a variety of EI techniques.Aside from showing individuals how they can get ahead by applying emotional intelligence in the workplace, Dr. Weisinger also explains how businesses can benefit through the application of EI on a company-wide basis. Because the development of EI leads to employees who are more creative, more fulfilled, and more enthusiastic, its promotion throughout an organization can improve productivity, speed adaptation to change, improve retention of key employees, and generally bolster that organization&#39;s competitive stance.A number of books have been written about the theories surrounding emotional intelligence. But this is the first to translate those theories into a pragmatic plan of action anyone can follow.

The two men debated the political problems faced by society, and the technological solutions engendered by the global network from the Arab Spring to Bitcoin. They outlined radically opposing perspectives: for Assange, the liberating power of the Internet is based on its freedom and statelessness. For Schmidt, emancipation is at one with US foreign policy objectives and is driven by connecting non-Western countries to American companies and markets. These differences embodied a tug-of-war over the Internet&#x2019;s future that has only gathered force subsequently.<br><br><i>When Google Met WikiLeaks</i> presents the story of Assange and Schmidt&#x2019;s encounter.

The first is to introduce students to applied econometrics, including basic techniques in regression analysis and some of the rich variety of models that are used when the linear model proves inadequate or inappropriate. The second is to present students with sufficient theoretical background that they will recognize new variants of the models learned about here as merely natural extensions that fit within a common body of principles. The Fifth Edition features a complete update of techniques and developments, a reorganization of material for improved presentation, and new material and applications.</p><p><p></p> <b>Key Features of ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS, Fifth Edition:</b> <ul> <li><b>Major reorganization of material.</b> The entire text has been reconstructed to help students' understanding of the material.</li> <li><b>Applied orientation.</b> Students learn how to do econometrics.</li> <li><b>Balanced coverage of topics.</b> Includes Classical, Bayesian, GMM, maximum likelihood, cross section, and more time series and panel data.</li> <li><b>Applications and numerical examples.</b> Detailed solutions to applications that show students how to do the computations.</li> <li><b>Attention to both linear and nonlinear techniques.</b> Software has made nonlinear estimation easy, inclusion of this information is now available.</li> <li><b>Students who purchase the text can visit</b> <b>www.prenhall.com/greene</b> to download the most current LIMDEP software and data sets.</li> </ul> <p></p><p><b>THE FIFTH EDITION OF ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS</b></p> <p> <i>Econometric Analysis</i> is intended for a one-year graduate course in econometrics for social scientists. The prerequisites for this course should include calculus, mathematical statistics, and an introduction to econometrics at the level of, say, <i>Gujarati's Basic Econometrics</i> (McGraw-Hill, 1995) or Wooldridge's <i>Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach</i> South-Western (2000). Self-contained (for our purposes) summaries of the matrix algebra, mathematical statistics, and statistical theory used later in the book are given in Appendices A through D. Appendix E contains a description of numerical methods that will be useful to practicing econometricians. The formal presentation of econometrics begins with discussion of a fundamental pillar, the linear multiple regression model, in Chapters 2 through 8. Chapters 9 through 15 present familiar extensions of the single linear equation model, including nonlinear regression, panel data models, the generalized regression model, and systems of equations. The linear model is usually not the sole technique used in most of the contemporary literature. In view of this, the (expanding) second half of this book is devoted to topics that will extend the linear regression model in many directions. Chapters 16 through 18 present the techniques and underlying theory of estimation in econometrics, including GMM and maximum likelihood estimation methods and simulation based techniques. We end in the last four chapters, 19 through 22, with discussions of current topics in applied econometrics, including time-series analysis and the analysis of discrete choice and limited dependent variable models. </p> <p> This book has two objectives. The first is to introduce students to <i>applied econometrics,</i> including basic techniques in regression analysis and some of the rich variety of models that are used when the linear model proves inadequate or inappropriate. The second is to present students with sufficient <i>theoretical background</i> that they will recognize new variants of the models learned about here as merely natural extensions that fit within a common body of principles. Thus, I have spent what might seem to be a large amount of effort explaining the mechanics of GMM estimation, nonlinear least squares, and maximum likelihood estimation and GARCH models. To meet the second objective, this book also contains a fair amount of theoretical material, such as that on maximum likelihood estimation and on asymptotic results for regression models. Modern software has made complicated modeling very easy to do, and an understanding of the underlying theory is important. </p> <p> I had several purposes in undertaking this revision. As in the past, readers continue to send me interesting ideas for my "next edition." It is impossible to use them all, of course. Because the five volumes of the <i>Handbook of Econometrics</i> and two of the <i>Handbook of Applied Econometrics</i> already run to over 4,000 pages, it is also unnecessary. Nonetheless, this revision is appropriate for several reasons. First, there are new and interesting developments in the field, particularly in the areas of microeconometrics (panel data, models for discrete choice) and, of course, in time series, which continues its rapid development. Second, I have taken the opportunity to continue fine-tuning the text as the experience and shared wisdom of my readers accumulates in my files. For this revision, that adjustment has entailed a substantial rearrangement of the material&#x2014;the main purpose of that was to allow me to add the new material in a more compact and orderly way than I could have with the table of contents in the 4th edition. The 15terature in econometrics has continued to evolve, and my third objective is to grow with it. This purpose is inherently difficult to accomplish in a textbook. Most of the literature is written by professionals for other professionals, and this textbook is written for students who are in the early stages of their training. But I do hope to provide a bridge to that literature, both theoretical and applied. </p> <p> This book is a broad survey of the field of econometrics. This field grows continually, and such an effort becomes increasingly difficult. (A partial list of journals devoted at least in part, if not completely, to econometrics now includes the <i>Journal of Applied Econometrics, Journal of Econometrics, Econometric Theory, Econometric Reviews, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, Empirical Economics,</i> and <i>Econometrica.</i>) Still, my view has always been that the serious student of the field must start somewhere, and one <i>can</i> successfully seek that objective in a single textbook. This text attempts to survey, at an entry level, enough of the fields in econometrics that a student can comfortably move from here to practice or more advanced study in one or more specialized areas. At the same time, I have tried to present the material in sufficient generality that the reader is also able to appreciate the important common foundation of all these fields and to use the tools that they all employ. </p> <p> There are now quite a few recently published texts in econometrics. Several have gathered in compact, elegant treatises, the increasingly advanced and advancing theoretical background of econometrics. Others, such as this book, focus more attention on applications of econometrics. One feature that distinguishes this work from its predecessors is its greater emphasis on nonlinear models. Davidson and MacKinnon (1993) is a noteworthy, but more advanced, exception. Computer software now in wide use has made estimation of nonlinear models as routine as estimation of linear ones, and the recent literature reflects that progression. My purpose is to provide a textbook treatment that is in fine with current practice. The book concludes with four lengthy chapters on time-series analysis, discrete choice models and limited dependent variable models. These nonlinear models are now the staples of the applied econometrics literature. This book also contains a fair amount of material that will extend beyond many first courses in econometrics, including, perhaps, the aforementioned chapters on limited dependent variables, the section in Chapter 22 on duration models, and some of the discussions of time series and panel data models. Once again, I have included these in the hope of providing a bridge to the professional literature in these areas. </p> <p> I have had one overriding purpose that has motivated all five editions of this work. For the vast majority of readers of books such as this, whose ambition is to use, not develop econometrics, I believe that it is simply not sufficient to recite the theory of estimation, hypothesis testing and econometric analysis. Understanding the often subtle background theory is extremely important. But, at the end of the day, my purpose in writing this work, and for my continuing efforts to update it in this now fifth edition, is to show readers how to <i>do</i> econometric analysis. I unabashedly accept the unflattering assessment of a correspondent who once likened this book to a "user's guide to econometrics." </p> <p><b>SOFTWARE AND DATA</b></p> <p> There are many computer programs that are widely used for the computations described in this book. All were written by econometricians or statisticians, and in general, all are regularly updated to incorporate new developments in applied econometrics.

Journals such as <i>The American Statistician, The Journal of Applied Econometrics,</i> and <i>The Journal of Economic Surveys</i> regularly publish reviews of individual packages and comparative surveys of packages, usually with reference to particular functionality such as panel data analysis or forecasting. </p> <p> With only a few exceptions, the computations described in this book can be carried out with any of these packages. We hesitate to link this text to any of them in particular. We have placed for general access a customized version of <i>LIMDEP,</i> which was also written by the author, on the website for this text, <b>www.prenhall.com/greene</b>. <i>LIMDEP</i> programs used for many of the computations are posted on the sites as well. </p> <p> The data sets used in the examples are also on the website.

Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underlie all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: those about (1) the effects of potential interventions, (2) probabilities of counterfactuals, and (3) direct and indirect effects (also known as &#34;mediation&#34;). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both. The tools are demonstrated in the analyses of mediation, causes of effects, and probabilities of causation.</p><p></p><h2>The Social and Economic History of the Hellenistic World</h2><p>Will be dispatched from UK.

A distinguished evolutionary biologist, Roughgarden takes on the medical establishment, the Bible, social science&#x2014;and even Darwin himself. She leads the reader through a fascinating discussion of diversity in gender and sexuality among fish, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals, including primates. <i>Evolution's Rainbow </i>explains how this diversity develops from the action of genes and hormones and how people come to differ from each other in all aspects of body and behavior. Roughgarden reconstructs primary science in light of feminist, gay, and transgender criticism and redefines our understanding of sex, gender, and sexuality. Witty, playful, and daring, this book will revolutionize our understanding of sexuality.<br><br>Roughgarden argues that principal elements of Darwinian sexual selection theory are false and suggests a new theory that emphasizes social inclusion and control of access to resources and mating opportunity. She disputes a range of scientific and medical concepts, including Wilson's genetic determinism of behavior, evolutionary psychology, the existence of a gay gene, the role of parenting in determining gender identity, and Dawkins's "selfish gene" as the driver of natural selection. She dares social science to respect the agency and rationality of diverse people; shows that many cultures across the world and throughout history accommodate people we label today as lesbian, gay, and transgendered; and calls on the Christian religion to acknowledge the Bible's many passages endorsing diversity in gender and sexuality. <i>Evolution's Rainbow </i>concludes with bold recommendations for improving education in biology, psychology, and medicine; for democratizing genetic engineering and medical practice; and for building a public monument to affirm diversity as one of our nation's defining principles.</p><p>"<i>Evolution's Rainbow </i>is an expansively creative challenge to the modern orthodoxies of sexual selection. Roughgarden's intellectual generosity may jump-start the careers of a new generation of diversity-affirming Darwinian scientists." Patricia Adair Gowaty, author of <i>Feminism and Evolutionary Biology </i><br><br>"An entrancing tale of sexual ambiguity in animals and people, but also that rarest of literary beasts a science book written from the heart." Steve Jones, author of <i>Darwin's Ghost </i><br><br>"A thoughtful and scholarly, yet deeply personal, perspective from a brilliant theoretical biologist. This articulate and provocative disquisition is must reading for anyone fascinated by one of the most important contemporary social challenges." Simon Levin, author of <i>Fragile Dominion</i><br><br>"This book challenges not only the assumptions about male-female differences in behavior and homosexual-heterosexual differences, but also the very meanings of maleness&#x2019; and femaleness&#x2019; in physical and biological terms. Roughgarden builds a strong case for biological diversity related to what humans call sex, gender, and sexuality." Bonnie Spanier, author of <i>Im/partial Science: Gender Ideology in Molecular Biology</i><br><br>"Joan Roughgarden asks, and indeed tries to answer, all the big questions about sexual diversity among humans and animals. She takes her readers on a wonderful journey through ecology and evolution and is a brilliant and talented narrator. <i>Evolution's Rainbow</i> will fundamentally change many ongoing conversations on sexuality and science." Judith Halberstam, author of <i>Female Masculinity</i><br><br>"Every now and then science focuses on a subject that matters. Gender and gender differences matter to us social primates. And we will judge, condemn, restrict or incarcerate people based on our notions of biologically normal variability in gender and sexuality. Thus, it is immensely important when a book comes along, written clearly and authoritatively by an eminent scientist, that demonstrates how wrong most people&#x2019;s ideas are about this subject. This is such a book." Robert Sapolsky, author of <i>A Primate&#x2019;s Memoir</i><b>Joan Roughgarden </b>is Professor of Biological Sciences at Stanford University.

It presents a unique foundation for producing almost every quantitative graphic found in scientific journals, newspapers, statistical packages, and data visualization systems. This foundation was designed for a distributed computing environment (Internet, Intranet, client-server), with special attention given to conserving computer code and system resources. While the tangible result of this work is a Java production graphics library (GPL) developed in collaboration with Dan Rope and Dan Carr, this book focuses on the deep structures involved in producing quantitative graphics from data. What are the rules that underly the production of pie charts, bar charts, scatterplots, function plots, maps, mosaics, radar charts? These rules are abstracted from the work of Bertin, Cleveland, Kosslyn, MacEachren, Pinker, Tufte, Tukey, Tobler, and other theorists of quantitative graphics. Those less interested in the theoretical and mathematical foundations can still get a sense of the richness and structure of the system by examining the numerous and often unique color graphics it can produce.

Biographer Roy Morris, Jr., focuses on the dozen years Twain spent overseas and on the popular travel books&#x2015;<i>The Innocents Abroad</i>, <i>A Tramp Abroad</i>, and <i>Following the Equator</i>&#x2015;he wrote about his adventures. Unintimidated by Old World sophistication and unafraid to travel to less developed parts of the globe, Twain encouraged American readers to follow him around the world at the dawn of mass tourism, when advances in transportation made leisure travel possible for an emerging middle class. In so doing, he helped lead Americans into the twentieth century and guided them toward more cosmopolitan views.</p><p>In his first book, <i>The Innocents Abroad</i> (1869), Twain introduced readers to the &#x201c;American Vandal,&#x201d; a brash, unapologetic visitor to foreign lands, unimpressed with the local ambiance but eager to appropriate any souvenir that could be carried off. He adopted this persona throughout his career, even after he grew into an international celebrity who dined with the German Kaiser, traded quips with the king of England, gossiped with the Austrian emperor, and negotiated with the president of Transvaal for the release of war prisoners. <i>American Vandal</i> presents an unfamiliar Twain: not the bred-in-the-bone Midwesterner we associate with Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer but a global citizen whose exposure to other peoples and places influenced his evolving positions on race, war, and imperialism, as both he and America emerged on the world stage.</p></p><p>Roy Morris, Jr., is the author of numerous books, including <i>Lighting Out for the Territory: How Samuel Clemens Headed West and Became Mark Twain</i>.<b>Morris</b> is a first-rate tour guide.

The most celebrated and prolific of modern architects, Wright built more than four hundred buildings and designed at least twice as many more. The characteristic features of his work--the open plan, dynamic space, fragmented volumes, natural materials, and integral structure--established the basic way that we think about modern architecture. For a general audience, this engaging book provides an introduction to Wright's remarkable accomplishments, as seen against the background of his eventful and often tragic life. For the architect or the architectural historian, it will be an important source of new insights into the development of Wright's whole body of work. It integrates biographical and historical material in a chronologically ordered framework that makes sense of his enormously varied career, and it provides over four hundred illustrations running parallel to the text.</p><br><p> Levine conveys the meanings of the continuities and changes that he sees I Wright's architecture and thought by focusing successive chapters on his most significant buildings, such as the Winslow House, Taliesin, Hollyhock House, Fallingwater, Tailsen west, and the Guggenheim Museum. A new understanding of the representational imagery and narrative structure of Wright's work, along with a much-needed reconsideration of its historical and contextual underpinnings, gives this study a unique place in the writings on Wright. In contrast to the emphasis a previous generation of critics and historians placed on Wright's earlier buildings, this book offers a broader perspective that sees Wright's later work as the culmination of his earlier efforts and the basis for a new understanding of the centrality of his career to the evolution of modern architecture as a whole.</p></p><p><p>"There is no other book that brings one closer to a sense of full understanding of Wright's architecture."--<b>Robin Middleton, Columbia University</b></p><b>Neil Levine</b> teaches the history of modern architecture at Harvard University, where he is the Emmet Blakeney Gleason Professor of Fine Arts.

Utilizing a wide range of historical sources and materials, this groundbreaking, interdisciplinary study pieces together a lost history of female creativity by focusing on the critical role emperors' wives played as patrons, collectors, taste-makers, and artists during the three-century Song dynasty (960&#x2013;1279), an era noted for spectacular cultural achievements.<br><br>The Song led China to unrivaled intellectual, socioeconomic, scientific, and urban advances. A flourishing printing culture helped spur a dramatic expansion of literacy that benefited women, whose talent in learning was often paired with virtue and was exemplified by the Song imperial women. Paralleling these developments was an unprecedented level of imperial patronage of the fine arts, including painting and calligraphy. However, while individual emperors such as Huizong (r. 1100&#x2013;1125) have long been recognized for their importance in this arena, the role played by imperial women has remained largely hidden, subject in part to the biases of Chinese historiography. Drawing against the backdrop of their formidable presence in court politics, Hui-shu Lee recounts and reveals the stories of their lives and art.<br><br>Lee focuses on such Song empresses as Liu, Wu, and Yang Meizi, artists and powerbrokers whose skill and influence helped shape the development of temple construction, sculpture, painting, and many other aspects of arts and culture. Acting in the shadow of the notorious female emperor Wu Zetian of the Tang dynasty, early Song imperial women began to define themselves through images and modes of expression that purposely concealed their power. In the process, they helped forge an effective and lasting model of female agency in China. In her exploration of Song imperial arts, Lee looks at ghost-writing, art collecting, didactic art, and the use of calligraphy and painting as gendered modes of expression. She draws on a number of disciplines, including art history, literature, history, and gender studies, to provide a unique account of the vital role of empresses in shaping Song art and culture.</p><p>This is the first book in any language devoted to the art of imperial women in China.

The book contests the idea that European colonialization led to a loss of Native American women's power, and instead presents a more complex picture of the adaption to, and subversion of, the economic changes introduced by Europeans. The essays also discuss the changing meainings of motherhood, women's roles and differing gender ideologies within this context.</p><p><strong>Nancy Shoemaker</strong> has taught history at St. Lawrence University and Texas Christian University. During the spring of 1994, she was a Monticello College Foundation Fellow at the Newbury Library in Chicago, Illinois."This combination of quality research and sophisticated understanding of cultural change makes Shoemaker's "Negotiators of Change an important contribution to the too-long neglected field of Native American women's history."<br>-"Journal of Social History <br>..."Shoemaker provides an excellent introduction to native North American women's history."<br>-"American Indian Culture and Research Journal <br>"The valuable collection of articles on the history of women and gender in American Indian societies offers readers intriguing new evidence and fresh interpretataions.

Volumes have been written on the subject, but until now there has never been a book like <em>Fishbugs.</em><br><br> Following the success of his first book, hailed as "the most useful book for eastern fly fishers since Art Flick's <em>Streamside Guide</em>," author Thomas Ames Jr. lets his photographic skills take center stage. His bigger-than-life studies of mayflies, caddisflies, and other waterborne insects, captured in extraordinary detail, allow you see them as never before. Fly tyers will appreciate them as models for their imitations, while naturalists and other lovers of nature photography admire them for their intrinsic beauty. His thoughtful prose examines the special characteristics that keep these fascinating insects at the heart of the angler's gentle art and underscores their value as indicators of the health of our inland waters.

Made of colored glass, with the details of the faces and costumes painted on the surface, the ancestors of Christ windows illuminated the liturgical areas during all but the earliest services in the depths of winter, glowing pale blue at dawn and yellow and red at noon. Dating from the twelfth century, the surviving windows from this series are among the oldest panels of stained glass in England, and they are significant examples of what was at the time a relatively new art&#x2014;monumental stained glass. They are also considered to be among the most famous works of English medieval painting.<br><br>This luminously illustrated book discusses the original context, iconographic program, and stylistic development of these windows.

Flannery describes the development of North America&#39;s deciduous forests and other flora, and tracks the immigration and emigration of various animals to and from Europe, Asia, and South America, showing how plant and animal species have either adapted or become extinct. The story takes in the massive changes wrought by the ice ages and the coming of the Indians, and continues right up to the present, covering the deforestation of the Northeast, the decimation of the buffalo, and other facets of the enormous impact of frontier settlement and the development of the industrial might of the United States. Natural history on a monumental scale, The Eternal Frontier contains an enormous wealth of fascinating scientific details, and Flannery&#39;s accessible and dynamic writing makes the book a delight to read. This is science writing at its very best -- a riveting page-turner that is simultaneously an accessible and scholarly trove of incredible information that is already being hailed by critics as a classic. &#34;Tim Flannery&#39;s account ... will fascinate Americans and non-Americans alike.&#34; -- Jared Diamond, author of Guns, Germs, and Steel &#34;No one before Flannery ... has been brave enough to tackle the whole pageant of North America.&#34; -- David Quammen, the New York Times Book Review &#34;Tim Flannery&#39;s book will forever change your perspective on the North American continent ... Exhilarating.&#34; -- John Terborgh, The New York Review of Books &#34;Full of engaging and attention-catching information about North America&#39;s geology, climate, and paleontology.&#34; -- Patricia Nelson Limerick, the Washington Post Book World &#34;Natural history par excellence.&#34; -- Kirkus Reviews (starred review) &#34;This gutsy Aussie may have read our landscape and ecological history with greater clarity than any native son.&#34; -- David A. Burney, Natural History &#34;A fascinating, current, and insightful look at our familiar history from a larger perspective.&#34; -- David Bezanson, Austin-American Statesman &#34;The scope of [Flannery&#39;s] story is huge, and his research exhaustive.&#34; -- Lauren Gravitz, The Christian Science Monitor</p><p>Reading <i>The Eternal Frontier</i> might be the closest you'll get to taking a class from Tim Flannery--and that alone makes it an opportunity just too good to pass up. This ambitious retelling of North America's dramatic ecological history grew out of a course that Flannery taught at Harvard surveying the continent's ancient past up to its tumultuous near-present: from the extraterrestrial "death-dealing visitor" that struck 65 million years ago all the way through to the tidal invasions, adaptations, and extinctions that have washed over North America since, each idiosyncratically influenced by an ever-changing geology, geography, and climate.<p> Flannery admirably balances his twin roles as scientist and storyteller. As a thoughtful teacher, he employs memorable and effective examples to illustrate broader topics, but he's also willing to commit to theoretical explanations (with fair warning) when necessary to thread together the narrative. But Flannery's greatest strength might simply be the empathy he inspires as a fellow human being trying to sort out an intricate, often richly beautiful puzzle. It's hard not to identify with his curiosity and enthusiasm, whether he's recalling memories of late nights spent as a child reading the <i>How and Why Book of Prehistoric Mammals</i> (and the uintathere nightmares that followed) or just marveling over the vast American West from his window seat on a plane.</p><p> <i>The Eternal Frontier</i> certainly leaves you with a solid outline of the how, why, and when of North America's enigmatic ecology, and what the implications of a dwindling frontier have for our future. But don't be surprised when what you remember best are Flannery's countless details--worthy of repeating at any self-respecting pub--from marsupial sperm that swim in pairs to the reason that Native American cultures might owe their very existence to squirrels' taste in nuts. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>If Nature itself has a nature, it's the desire for balance. In a fascinating chronicle of our continent's evolution, Flannery shows, however, that this desire must forever be frustrated. Flannery starts his tale with the asteroid collision that destroyed the dinosaurs, ends with the almost equally cataclysmic arrival of humankind and fills the middle with an engaging survey of invaders from other lands, wild speciation and an ever-changing climate, all of which have kept the ecology of North America in a constant state of flux. We see the rise of horses, camels and dogs (cats are Eurasian), the rapid extinction of mammoths, mastodons and other megafauna at the hands of prehistoric man, and the even quicker extinction of the passenger pigeon and other creatures more recently. Flannery also spotlights plenty of scientists at work, most notably one who tries to butcher an elephant as a prehistoric man would have butchered a mastodon, and another who had the intestinal fortitude to check whether meat would keep if a carcass were stored at the bottom of a frigid pond, the earliest of refrigerators. This material might be dense and academic in another's hands, but Flannery displays a light touch, a keen understanding of what will interest general readers and a good sense of structure, which keeps the book moving, manageable and memorable. (May)Forecast: Atlantic Monthly clearly intends to build on the reputation Flannery attained with his previous, highly acclaimed book, Throwim Way Leg and they may have a winner here. The first printing will be 60,000 copies, with a $100,000 promotional budget and a 21-city author tour.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Latin for Americans Level 1: Writing Activities Workbook</h2><p>Latin for Americans Level 1, Writing Activities Workbook</p><p>McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>Working Papers, Chapters 1-16 for Gilbertson/Lehman/Ross&#39; Century 21 Accounting: General Journal, 8th</h2><p>Century 21&#39;s new approach to Working Papers simplifies the paper trail.

Although individual pioneers&#39; visions of paradise were inevitably corrupted by reality, some determined idealists carved out enclaves in order to develop collective models of what they believed to be more perfect societies. All such communitarian groups consciously attempted to express their social ideals in their buildings and landscapes; invariably, ideological predispositions can be inferred from a close study of the environments they created. The interplay between ideology and architecture, the social design and the physical design of American utopian communities, is the basis of this remarkable Dolores Hayden.

Parrillo experienced multiculturalism early as the son of a second-generation Italian American father and Irish/German American mother. He grew up in an ethnically diverse neighborhood, developing friendships and teenage romances with second- and third-generation Dutch, German, Italian, and Polish Americans. As he grew older, he developed other friendships that frequently crossed racial and religious lines.</p> <p>Professor Parrillo came to the field of sociology after first completing a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in business management and a master&#x2019;s degree in English. After teaching high school English and then serving as a college administrator, he took his first sociology course when he began doctoral studies at Rutgers University. Inspired by a discipline that scientifically investigates social issues, he changed his major and completed his degree in sociology. </p> <p>Leaving his administrative post but staying at William Paterson University, Prof. Parrillo has since taught sociology for more than 30 years. He has lectured throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe and has regularly conducted diversity leadership programs for the military and large corporations. His keynote address at a bilingual educators&#x2019; conference was published in <i>Vital Speeches of the Day,</i> which normally contains only speeches by national political leaders and heads of corporations and organizations.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Prof. Parrillo was a Fulbright Scholar in the Czech Republic and Scholar-in-Residence at the University of Pisa. He was the keynote speaker at international conferences in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Sweden. He has met with government leaders, nongovernment agency leaders, law enforcement officials, and educators in more than a dozen countries as a consultant on immigration policy, hate crimes, and multicultural education. He has done on-air interviews with <i>Radio Free Europe</i> and <i>Voice of America,</i> appeared on national Canadian television, and been interviewed by numerous Canadian and European reporters.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Prof. Parrillo&#x2019;s ventures into U.S. media include writing, narrating, and producing two PBS award-winning documentaries, <i>Ellis Island: Gateway to America</i> and <i>Smokestacks and Steeples: A Portrait of Paterson.</i> Contacted by reporters across the nation for his views on race and ethnic relations, he has been quoted in dozens of newspapers, including the <i>Chicago</i> <i> Sun-Times, Cincinnati Inquirer, Houston Chronicle, Hartford Courant, Omaha World-Herald, Orlando Sentinel,</i> and <i>Virginian Pilot.</i> He has appeared on numerous U.S. radio and television programs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Prof. Parrillo is also the author of <i>Understanding Race and Ethnic Relations,</i> third edition (Allyn &amp; Bacon), <i>Contemporary Social Problems,</i> sixth edition (Allyn &amp; Bacon), <i>Cities and Urban Life,</i> fourth edition (with John Macionis), <i>Diversity in America,</i> second edition, and <i>Rethinking Today&#x2019;s Minorities.</i> His articles and book reviews have appeared in journals such as <i>The Social Science Journal, Sociological Forum, Social Forces, Journal of Comparative Family Studies, Journal of American Ethnic History, </i>and the <i>Encyclopedia of American Immigration.</i> He is General Editor of the <i>Encyclopedia of Sociology</i> for Sage Publications<i>.</i> Several of his books and articles have been translated into other languages, including Chinese, Czech, Danish, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, and Swedish.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>An active participant in various capacities throughout the years in the American Sociological Association and Eastern Sociological Society, Prof. Parrillo has been listed in <i>Who&#x2019;s Who in International Education, Outstanding Educators of America, American Men and Women of Science,</i> and <i>Who&#x2019;s Who in the East.</i> In 2004, he received the Award for Excellence in Scholarship from William Paterson University. In March 2005, the Eastern Sociological Society named him its Robin M. Williams, Jr. Distinguished Lecturer for 2005&#x2014;2006, and elected him as its vice president for 2008&#x2014;2009.</p><p>&#x201c;Provides not only an excellent survey and analysis of prominent issues...but also offers sharp and empirically sound studies of the ethnoracial, gender, and other minority groups in the United States.&nbsp; One of the best texts in race and ethnic relations.&#x201d;&nbsp; </p> <p>Stanford M. Lyman, <i>Florida Atlantic University</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&#x201c;A common word used in the assessment of this book by several sociologists is <i>comprehensive</i>....We are invited to read in the pages that follow the story of a resilient society that is struggling to achieve unity out of diversity and, at the same time, guarantee the right to be different....Of special value in this book are the sociological concepts and theories in Part I that are helpful in interpreting and understanding how and why strangers to these shores have adapted to the customs of this country they way they have....Professor Parrillo has made a major contribution to the study of intergroup relations. </p> <p>Charles V. Willie, <i>Harvard University</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Strangers to These Shores is...a comprehensive examination of the sharpest edges and more nuanced qualities of American pluralism.&nbsp; In its 15 chapters, Professor Parrillo provides students/readers&#x2014;and those for whom it is not assigned!&#x2014;with a well conceived, carefully constructed, and highly readable introduction to a very complex subject.&#x201d;&nbsp; </p> <p>Peter I. Rose, <i>Smith College</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Parrillo effectively captures the creative energy and tension of the multiracial, multiethnic reality that is American reality&#x2014;historically, theoretically, and empirically.&#x201d; </p> <p>&nbsp;Walda Katz-Fishman, <i>Howard University</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;A theoretically informed and historically rich account...with a comprehensive, up-to-date treatment [that] makes it an indispensable guide to the evolution and current state of minority-majority relations.&nbsp; I recommend it highly for classroom use.&#x201d;&nbsp; </p> <p>Richard D. Alba, <i>CUNY Graduate Center</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;How wonderful&nbsp; to find between the covers of a single volume the experiences of more than a hundred ethnic groups in America presented in concise fashion against a backdrop of major sociological themes.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p> <p>Betty Lee Sung, <i>CUNY</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&#x201c;From its opening reflections on the stranger as a social phenomenon to its thoughtful conclusion on the nature and future of the American mosaic, Strangers to These Shores remains one of the best textbooks ever published on race and ethnic relations in the United States. Freshly updated with an eye for detail, engagingly written and a pleasure to read, this new edition practices what it preaches: Parrillo takes diversity in America seriously and seeks to understand it through historically-grounded&nbsp; analyses of the variety of patterns of majority-minority relations and with richly drawn portraits of scores of groups who have made this the world&#x2019;s most ethnically diverse society.&nbsp; An excellent introduction to a challenging, complex, and ever-changing field of study.&#x201d;&nbsp; </p> <p>Ruben G.

Each selection featured here is a key writing by a leading pragmatist thinker, and represents a distinctively pragmatist approach to a core philosophical problem. The collection includes work by pragmatism's founders, Charles Peirce, William James, and John Dewey, as well as seminal writings by mid-twentieth-century pragmatists such as Sidney Hook, C. I. Lewis, Nelson Goodman, Rudolf Carnap, Wilfrid Sellars, and W.V.O. Quine. This reader also includes the most important work in contemporary pragmatism by philosophers like Susan Haack, Cornel West, Hilary Putnam, Richard Rorty, Cheryl Misak, and Robert Brandom. Each selection is a stand-alone piece--not an excerpt or book chapter--and each is presented fully unabridged.</p><br><br><p> <i>The Pragmatism Reader</i> challenges the notion that pragmatism fell into a midcentury decline and was dormant until the advent of "neopragmatism" in the 1980s. This comprehensive anthology reveals a rich and highly influential tradition running unbroken through twentieth-century philosophy and continuing today. It shows how American pragmatist philosophers have contributed to leading philosophical debates about truth, meaning, knowledge, experience, belief, existence, justification, and freedom.</p><p> </p><ul><br> <li>Covers pragmatist philosophy from its origins to today </li><br> <li>Features key writings by the leading pragmatist thinkers </li><br> <li>Demonstrates the continuity and enduring influence of pragmatism </li><br> <li>Challenges prevailing notions about pragmatism </li><br> <li>Includes only stand-alone pieces, completely unabridged </li><br> <li>Reflects the full range of pragmatist themes, arguments, concerns, and commitments</li><br> </ul><p></p></p><p><p>"With an excellent selection of papers by all the classical pragmatists and a very well judged collection of pieces by more recent philosophers sympathetic to pragmatism, this superb volume provides material for a successful course on pragmatism and also offers readers a fascinating overview of its varieties."<b>--Christopher Hookway, University of Sheffield</b></p><p>"The alleged patterns of storied philosophies are always contestable, and contested. Do they reflect objective joints or only artificial impositions? This collection helps to show just how objective the pattern of pragmatism is, and how broad its scope. It is a welcome arrangement of skillfully selected contributions."<b>--Ernest Sosa, Rutgers University</b></p><p>"An excellent collection. <i>The Pragmatism Reader</i> currently offers the best selection of writings from the pragmatist tradition, and successfully presents the movement as a continuous and coherent strain in twentieth- and twenty-first-century philosophy."<b>--Henry Jackman, York University</b></p><p>"<i>The Pragmatism Reader</i> does a much better job of bringing into bold relief the continuities in the development of pragmatism from its inception to the present than does any other anthology. Talisse and Aikin's introduction is bold and original and helps the reader to see these strands of continuity among the different pieces included here."<b>--Richard M. Gale, professor emeritus, University of Pittsburgh</b></p><b>Robert B. Talisse</b> is professor of philosophy at Vanderbilt University. His books include <i>A Pragmatist Philosophy of Democracy</i>. <b>Scott F. Aikin</b> is senior lecturer in philosophy at Vanderbilt.

His witty, clever drama, populated by brilliant talkers skilled in the art of riposte and paradox, are still staples of the theatrical repertoire.<br><i>An Ideal Husband</i> revolves around a blackmail scheme that forces a married couple to reexamine their moral standards &#x2014; providing, along the way, a wry commentary on the rarity of politicians who can claim to be ethically pure. A supporting cast of young lovers, society matrons, an overbearing father, and a formidable femme fatale continually exchange sparkling repartee, keeping the play moving at a lively pace.<br>Like most of Wilde's plays, this scintillating drawing-room comedy is wise, well-constructed, and deeply satisfying. An instant success at its 1895 debut, the play continues to delight audiences over one hundred years later. <i>An Ideal Husband</i> is a must-read for Wilde fans, students of English literature, and anyone delighted by wit, urbanity, and timeless sophistication.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Poet and playwright Oscar Wilde (1854&#x2013;1900) remains best known for his comedies of the 1890s, including <i>The Importance of Being Earnest,</i> and for his tragic imprisonment and untimely death. </p>The L.A. Theatre Works performs plays tailored for a radio format before live audiences. The works are treats for the ear: Each features first-rate performances, rich but not overdone sound effects, evocative background music, expert engineering and the immediacy of an audience&#39;s live responses. AN IDEAL HUSBAND, Oscar Wilde&#39;s 1895 comedy, shows how a good adaptation of a classic play can speak to the present age. Martin Jarvis and director Michael Hackett have slightly streamlined Wilde&#39;s play about a rising politician with a secret in his past whose efforts to prevent exposure call attention to the hypocrisy of holding our leaders to higher standards than we ourselves live by. The large cast handles the witty dialogue with delicacy: Jacqueline Bisset charmingly plays one of dramatic literature&#39;s most polite blackmailers. The insouciance of the performances emphasizes rather than detracts from the play&#39;s serious theme of social hypocrisy. G.H.

Through trenchant analysis, Nicole R. Fleetwood reorients the problem of black visibility by turning attention to what it means to see blackness and to the performative codes that reinforce, resignify, and disrupt its meaning. Working across visual theory and performance studies, Fleetwood asks, How is the black body visualized as both familiar and disruptive? How might we investigate the black body as a troubling presence to the scopic regimes that define it as such? How is value assessed based on visible blackness?<br> Fleetwood documents multiple forms of engagement with the visual, even as she meticulously underscores how the terms of engagement change in various performative contexts. Examining a range of practices from the documentary photography of Charles &#x201c;Teenie&#x201d; Harris to the &#x201c;excess flesh&#x201d; performances of black female artists and pop stars to the media art of Fatimah Tuggar to the iconicity of Michael Jackson, Fleetwood reveals and reconfigures the mechanics, codes, and metaphors of blackness in visual culture.<br> &#x201c;<i>Troubling Vision</i> is a path-breaking book that examines the problem of seeing blackness&#x2014;the simultaneous hyper-visibility and invisibility of African Americans&#x2014;in US visual culture in the last half century. Weaving together critical modes and methodologies from performance studies, art history, critical race studies, visual culture analysis, and gender theory, Fleetwood expands Du Bois&#x2019;s idea of double vision into a broad questioning of whether &#x2018;representation itself will resolve the problem of the black body in the field of vision.&#x2019; With skilled attention to historical contexts, documentary practices, and media forms, she takes up the works of a broad variety of cultural producers, from photographers and playwrights to musicians and visual artists and examines black spectatorship as well as black spectacle. In chapters on the trope of &#x2018;non-iconicity&#x2019; in the photographs of Charles (Teenie) Harris, the &#x2018;visible seams&#x2019; in the digital images of the artist Fatimah Tuggar, and a coda on the un-dead Michael Jackson, Fleetwood's close analyses soar. <i>Troubling Vision</i> is a beautifully written, original, and important addition to the field of American Studies.&#x201d;&#x2014;Announcement of the American Studies Association for the 2012 Lora Romero First Book Publication Prize</p> <p></p></p><p><b>Nicole R. Fleetwood </b>is assistant professor of American studies at Rutgers University and an art consultant who has worked with numerous museums and art institutions.&#x201c;A compelling contribution to scholarship on blackness and visuality, this text provides a heterogeneous yet complimentary sampling of black visual artists who, in method and form, challenge that power-laden visual exchange by exposing their flesh in excess, by making doubly visible the seams holding dominant discourses together, and by celebrating the non-iconic, everyday performances of blackness.&#x201d; (<i>Women &amp; Performance</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In <i>Troubling Vision</i>, Fleetwood effectively engages multiple theories from across disciplines to offer fresh readings of cultural texts that question black visibility. She gives us a new language with which to disrupt narratives of blackness as overdetermined difference, as well as a new way of seeing black subjectivity and the black body in performance and visual culture.&#x201d; (<i>Theatre Journal</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Nicole Fleetwood&#x2019;s remarkable study alerts us to how troubling enactments like non-iconicity, excess flesh, and the visible seam radically reorient 'the psychic and affective domains of seeing and doing black,' thus revealing new terrain on which to construct political, social, and cultural theories of visual blackness. . . . <i>Troubling Vision</i> should quickly become standard reading for those looking for new insight&#x2014;and new methods&#x2014;in black visual and performance studies.&#x201d; (Douglas A. Jones, Jr. <i>TDR: the drama review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;What kind of fetish is the black body, and how do traditional logics of racial visibility reproduce its &#x2018;troubling&#x2019; presence across representational genres and pop cultural forms? Nicole Fleetwood has crafted a truly powerful and compellingly interdisciplinary answer to those interconnected questions, recalibrating and superseding age-old debates about the politics and poetics of visual culture. <i>Troubling Vision</i> demonstrates how visual and other artists&#x2014;photographers and playwrights, performance artists and pop singers&#x2014;confound the tropes of pathology that have long prefigured and overdetermined views of blackness as conspicuous difference. This very readable and theoretically sophisticated book focuses on some of the ways in which black artists resist the too-easy lure of self-evident iconicity, leaving subtle and not so subtle traces of the hard work that debunking racist stereotypes entails. Fleetwood&#x2019;s offering is smart, at times quite personal, even moving, and a must-read for scholars working at the nexus of race and performativity, African American studies, and visual theory.&#x201d; (John L. Jackson Jr. <i>University of Pennsylvania</i>)<br><br>"Fleetwood persuasively navigates the spaces between visual studies, psychoanalytic theory, performance theory, feminist theory, and black cultural studies to produce a remarkable analysis of black subjectivity and visuality in our contemporary moment." (<i>Callaloo</i>)<br><br><p>&#x201c;<i>Troubling Vision</i> contributes vitally to new work in visual and performance studies as well as black popular culture. The book&#x2019;s sophisticated renderings of blackness reveal the significance of seeing in feminist media, photographs, and fashion from the Harlem Renaissance to Michael Jackson. A fascinating study!&#x201d;</p> (Jennifer Brody <i>Duke University</i>)<br><br>"Nicole Fleetwood&#x2019;s <i>Troubling Vision</i> is a fascinating study of black visuality and contributes greatly to the fields of performance, visual, and critical race studies . . . .<i>Troubling Vision</i> [is] aesthetically seductive and theoretically smart."

However, this skill seems to have disappeared. <i>Beauty Memory Unity</i>&nbsp;points toward a possibility of regaining a new sense of unity in the visual arts through a combination of theoretical ideas and practical methods, of narrative description and visual exercises.<br><br>Proportion&#x2015;the use of number and geometry as the tools of design&#x2015;is seen in the context of the search for the Beautiful, a state the soul achieves when one recognizes the phenomenon of unity. From the theoretical symbolic mathematics of the Pythagoreans, Platonists, and Neo-Platonists, Steve Bass proposes an aesthetic theory&#x2015;a way of approaching beauty&#x2015;rooted in the idea of psyche, expressed through the ancient arts and sciences of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy.<br><br>&#x201c;All those possessing even a small share of good sense always call upon the Divinity at the outset of any undertaking, small or great; therefore we, who are proposing to present a discourse concerning the universe, must invoke the Gods and Goddesses, praying that all we say may be approved by them in the first place, and second by us. Grant then that we have duly invoked the Deities; we must also invoke ourselves so that you may most easily learn, and I may most clearly expound on the subjects before us.<br><br>&#x201c;Thus Socrates, if in our treatment of a great host of matters regarding the Gods and the generation of the Universe we prove unable to give accounts that are always in all respects self-consistent and perfectly exact, do not be surprised; rather we should be content if we can furnish accounts that are inferior to none in likelihood, remembering that both I who speak and you who judge are but human creatures, so that it becomes us to accept the likely account of these matters and forebear to search beyond it.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>Plato</b>&nbsp;(<i>Timaeus</i>&nbsp;27)</p><p><b>Steve Bass</b>&nbsp;was born in 1947 in Brooklyn, New York.

Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>Kurt Vonnegut is a unique voice in the American canon &#x2014; a writer whose works are hard to categorize, often straddling the space between literature and science fiction, and filled with cutting satire and dark humor. Like Mark Twain before him, Vonnegut's reputation and impact on American writing and reading will continue to grow steadily and increase in relevance as new insights are made. Vonnegut was born in 1922 in Indianapolis, and studied at the University of Chicago and the University of Tennessee. In the Second World War, he became a German prisoner of war and was present during the bombing of Dresden. This experience provided inspiration for his most successful and influential novel, Slaughterhouse-Five. Vonnegut &#x2014; admired as much for his views and his &#x201c;Vonnegutisms&#x201d; as for his publications &#x2014; wrote extensively in many forms, including novels, short stories, essays, plays, articles, speeches, and correspondence, some of which was published posthumously.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br><i>The First Amendment<br></i><br>I am a member of what I believe to be the last recognizable generation of full-time, life-time American novelists. We appear to be standing more or less in a row. It was the Great Depression which made us similarly edgy and watchful. It was World War II which lined us up so nicely, whether we were men or women, whether we were ever in uniform or not. It was an era of romantic anarchy in publishing which gave us money and mentors, willy-nilly, when we were young&#x2013;while we learned our craft. Words printed on pages were still the principal form of long-distance communication and stored information in America when we were young.<br><br>No more.<br><br>Nor are there many publishers and editors and agents left who are eager to find some way to get money and other forms of encouragement to young writers who write as clumsily as member of my literary generation did when we started out. The wild and wonderful and expensive guess was made back then that we might acquire some wisdom and learn how to write halfway decently by and by. Writers were needed that much back then.<br><br>It was an amusing and instructive time for writers&#x2013;for hundreds of them.<br><br>Television wrecked the short-story branch of the industry, and now accountants and business school graduates dominate book publishing. They feel that money spent on someone's first novel is good money down a rat hole. They are right. It almost always is.<br><br>So, as I say, I think I belong to America's last generation of novelists. Novelists will come one by one from now on, not in seeming families, and will perhaps write only one or two novels, and let it go at that. Many will have inherited or married money.<br><br>The most influential of my bunch, in my opinion, is still J. D. Salinger, although he has been silent for years. The most promising was perhaps Edward Lewis Wallant, who died so young. And it is my thinking about the death of James Jones two years ago, who was not all that young, who was almost exactly my age, which accounts for the autumnal mood of this book. There have been other reminders of my own mortality, to be sure, but the death of Jones is central&#x2013;perhaps because I see his widow Gloria so often and because he, too, was a self-educated midwesterner, and because he, too, in a major adventure for all of us, which was the Second World War, had been an enlisted man. And let it here be noted that the best-known members of my literary generation, if they wrote about war, almost unanimously despised officers and made heroes of sketchily educated, aggressively unaristocratic enlisted men.<br><br>� � �<br><br>James Jones told me one time that his publisher and Ernest Hemingway's, Charles Scribner's Sons, had once hoped to get Jones and Hemingway together&#x2013;so that they could enjoy each other's company as old warriors.<br><br>Jones declined, by his own account, because he did not regard Hemingway as a fellow soldier. He said Hemingway in wartime was free to come and go from the fighting as he pleased, and to take time off for a fine meal or woman or whatever. Real soldiers, according to Jones, damn well had to stay where they were told, or go where they were told, and eat swill, and take the worst the enemy had to throw at them day after day, week after week.<br><br>� � �<br><br>It may be that the most striking thing about members of my literary generation in retrospect will be that we were allowed to say absolutely anything without fear of punishment. Our American heirs may find it incredible, as most foreigners do right now, that a nation would want to enforce as a law something which sounds more like a dream, which reads as follows:<br><br>"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."<br><br>How could a nation with such a law raise its children in an atmosphere of decency? It couldn't&#x2013;it can't. So the law will surely be repealed soon for the sake of children.<br><br>And even now my books, along with books by Bernard Malamud and James Dickey and Joseph Heller and many other first-rate patriots, are regularly thrown out of public-school libraries by school board members, who commonly say that they have not actually read the books, but that they have it on good authority that the books are bad for children.<br><br>� � �<br><br>My novel <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> was actually burned in a furnace by a school janitor in Drake, North Dakota, on instructions from the school committee there, and the school board made public statements about the unwholesomeness of the book. Even by the standards of Queen Victoria, the only offensive line in th entire novel is this: "Get out of the road, you dumb motherfucker." This is spoken by an American antitank gunner to an unarmed American chaplain's assistant during the Battle of the Bulge in Europe in December 1944, the largest single defeat of American arms (the Confederacy excluded) in history. The chaplain's assistant had attracted enemy fire.<br><br>So on November 16, 1973, I wrote as follows to Charles McCarthy of Drake, North Dakota:<br><br>Dear Mr. McCarthy:<br><br>I am writing to you in your capacity as chairman of the Drake School Board. I am among those American writers whose books have been destroyed in the now famous furnace of your school.<br><br>Certain members of your community have suggested that my work is evil. This is extraordinarily insulting to me. The news from Drake indicates to me that books and writers are very unreal to you people. I am writing this letter to let you know how real I am.<br><br>I want you to know, too, that my publisher and I have done absolutely nothing to exploit the disgusting news from Drake. We are not clapping each other on the back, crowing about all the books we will sell because of the news. We have declined to go on television, have written no fiery letters to editorial pages, have granted no lengthy interviews. We are angered and sickened and saddened. And no copies of this letter have been sent to anybody else. You now hold the only copy in your hands. It is a strictly private letter from me to the people of Drake, who have done so much to damage my reputation in the eyes of their children and then in the eyes of the world. Do you have the courage and ordinary decency to show this letter to the people, or will it, too, be consigned to the fires of your furnace?<br><br>I gather from what I read in the papers and hear on television that you imagine me, and some other writers, too, as being sort of ratlike people who enjoy making money from poisoning the minds of young people. I am in fact a large, strong person, fifty-one years old, who did a lot of farm work as a boy, who is good with tools. I have raised six children, three my own and three adopted. They have all turned out well. Two of them are farmers. I am a combat infantry veteran from World War II, and hold a Purple Heart. I have earned whatever I own by hard work. I have never been arrested or sued for anything. I am so much trusted with young people and by young people that I have served on the faculties of the University of Iowa, Harvard, and the City College of New York. Every year I receive at least a dozen invitations to be commencement speaker at colleges and high schools. My books are probably more widely used in schools than those of any other living American fiction writer.<br><br>If you were to bother to read my books, to behave as educated persons would, you would learn that they are not sexy, and do not argue in favor of wildness of any kind. They beg that people be kinder and more responsible than they often are. It is true that some of the characters speak coarsely. That is because people speak coarsely in real life. Especially soldiers and hardworking men speak coarsely, and even our most sheltered children know that. And we all know, too, that those words really don't damage children much. They didn't damage us when we were young. It was evil deeds and lying that hurt us.<br><br>After I have said all this. I am sure you are still ready to respond, in effect, "Yes, yes&#x2013;but it still remains our right and our responsibility to decide what books our children are going to be made to read in our community." This is surely so. But it is also true that if you exercise that right and fulfill that responsibility in an ignorant, harsh, un-American manner, then people are entitled to call you bad citizens and fools. Even your own children are entitled to call you that.<br><br>I read in the newspaper that your community is mystified by the outcry from all over the country about what you have done. Well, you have discovered that Drake is a part of American civilization, and your fellow Americans can't stand it that you have behaved in such an uncivilized way. Perhaps you will learn from this that books are sacred to free men for very good reasons, and that wars have been fought against nations which hate books and burn them. If you are an American, you must allow all ideas to circulate freely in your community, not merely your own.<br><br>If you and your board are now determined to show that you in fact have wisdom and maturity when you exercise your powers over the eduction of your young, then you should acknowledge that it was a rotten lesson you taught young people in a free society when you denounced and then burned books&#x2013;books you hadn't even read. You should also resolve to expose your children to all sorts of opinions and information, in order that they will be better equipped to make decisions and to survive.<br><br>Again: you have insulted me, and I am a good citizen, and I am very real.<br><br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�<br><br>That was seven years ago. There has so far been no reply. At this very moment, as I write in New York City, <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> has been banned from school libraries not fifty miles from here. A legal battle begun several years ago rages on. The school board in question has found lawyers eager to attack the First Amendment tooth and nail. There is never a shortage anywhere of lawyers eager to attack the First Amendment, as though it were nothing more than a clause in a lease from a crooked slumlord.<br><br>At the start of that particular litigation, on March 24th of 1976, I wrote a comment for the Op-Ed page of the Long Island edition of <i>The New York Times</i>. It went like this:<br><br>A school board has denounced some books again&#x2013;out in Levittown this time. One of the books was mine. I hear about un-American nonsense like this twice a year or so. One time out in North Dakota, the books were actually burned in a furnace. I had a laugh. It was such an ignorant, dumb, superstitious thing to do.<br><br>It was so cowardly, too&#x2013;to make a great show of attacking artifacts. It was like St. George attacking bedspreads and cuckoo clocks.<br><br>Yes, and St. Georges like that seem to get elected or appointed to school committees all the time. They are actually proud of their illiteracry. They imagine that they are somehow celebrating the bicentennial when they boast, as some did in Levittown, that they hadn't actually read the books they banned.<br><br>Such lunks are often the backbone of volunteer fire departments and the United States Infantry and cake sales and so on, and they have been thanked often enough for that. But they have no business supervising the eductions of children in a free society. They are just too bloody stupid.<br><br>Here is how I propose to end book-banning in this country once and for all: Every candidate for school committee should be hooked up to a lie-detector and asked this question: "Have you read a book from start to finish since high school? Or did you even read a book from start to finish in high school?"<br><br>If the truthful answer is "no," then the candidate should be told politely that he cannot get on the school committee and blow off his big bazoo about how books make children crazy.<br><br>Whenever ideas are squashed in this country, literate lovers of the American experiment write careful and intricate explanations of why all ideas must be allowed to live. It is time for them to realize that they are attempting to explain America at its bravest and most optimistic to orangutans.<br><br>From now on, I intend to limit my discourse with dimwitted Savonarolas to this advice: "Have somebody read the First Amendment to the United States Constitution out loud to you, you God damned fool!"<br><br>Well&#x2013;the American Civil Liberties Union or somebody like that will come to the scene of trouble, as they always do. They will explain what is in the Constitution, and to whom it applies.<br><br>They will win.<br><br>And there will be millions who are bewildered and heartbroken by the legal victory, who think some things should never be said&#x2013;especially about religion.<br><br>They are in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br><br>Hi ho.<br><br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;<br><br>Why is it so ordinary for American citizens to show such scorn for the First Amendment? I discussed that some at a fund raiser for the American Civil Liberties Union at Sands Point, New York, out on Long Island, on September 16, 1979. The house where I spoke, incidentally, was said to be the model for Gatsby's house in F. Scott Fitzgerald's <i>The Great Gatsby</i>. I saw no reason to doubt the claim.<br><br>I said this in such a setting:<br><br>"I will not speak directly to the ejection of my book <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> from the school libraries of Island Trees. I have a vested interest. I wrote the book, after all, so why wouldn&#x2019;t I argue that it is less repulsive than the school board says?<br><br>"I will speak of Thomas Aquinas instead. I will tell you my dim memories of what he said about the hierarchy of laws on this planet, which was flat at the time. The highest law, he said, was divine law, God's law. Beneath that was natural law, which I suppose would include thunderstorms, and our right to shield our children from poisonous ideas, and so on.<br><br>"And the lowest law was human law.<br><br>"Let me clarify this scheme by comparing its parts to playing cards. Enemies of the Bill of Rights do the same sort of thing all the time, so why shouldn't we? Divine law, then, is an ace. Natural law is a king. The Bill of Rights is a lousy queen.<br><br>"The Thomist hierarchy of laws is so far from being ridiculous that I have never met anybody who did not believe in it right down to the marrow of his or her bones. Everybody knows that there are laws with more grandeur than those which are printed in our statute books. The big trouble is that there is so little agreement as to how those grander laws are worded. Theologians can give us hints of the wording, but it takes a dictator to set them down just right&#x2013;to dot the <i>i</i>'s and cross the <i>t</i>'s. A man who had been a mere corporal in the army did that for Germany and then for all of Europe, you may remember, not long ago. There was nothing he did not know about divine and natural law. He had fistfuls of aces and kings to play.<br><br>"Meanwhile, over on this side of the Atlantic, we were not playing with a full deck, as they say.

This vibrant document is also essential to understanding the forms of conviviality developed in Central Italy during the Renaissance, as well as their sociopolitical implications. In addition to the original text, this first complete English translation of the work includes a historical essay by Luigi Ballerini and fifty modernized recipes by acclaimed Italian chef Stefania Barzini. <br><br><i>The Art of Cooking, </i>unlike the culinary manuals of the time, is a true gastronomic lexicon, surprisingly like a modern cookbook in identifying the quantity and kinds of ingredients in each dish, the proper procedure for cooking them, and the time required, as well as including many of the secrets of a culinary expert. In his lively introduction, Luigi Ballerini places Maestro Martino in the complicated context of his time and place and guides the reader through the complexities of Italian and papal politics. Stefania Barzini's modernized recipes that follow the text bring the tastes of the original dishes into line with modern tastes. Her knowledgeable explanations of how she has adapted the recipes to the contemporary palate are models of their kind and will inspire readers to recreate these classic dishes in their own kitchens. Jeremy Parzen's translation is the first to gather the entire corpus of Martino's legacy.</p><p>"Surely one of the most significant writings ever concerning the origins and methods of Western cookery. As a pure cookbook, it is a collection of Maestro Martino of Como's precise, workable recipes, each preaching the value and preservation of basic flavors&#x2015;a revolutionary concept for his time. As an historical resource, <i>The Art of Cooking </i>places the Maestro's food comfortably within its Renaissance context while at the same time establishing his steady march into culinary modernism. An invaluable book."&#x2015;Fred Ferretti, former "Gourmet at Large" columnist, <i>Gourmet Magazine</i><br><br>"I applaud the publication of <i>The Art of Cooking</i> by Maestro Martino. With this fine translation of his culinary opus, Martino will be restored to his rightful place in gastronomical history. Stefania Barzini&#x2019;s adaptations for the contemporary palate will surely inspire many readers to try their hands in the kitchen."&#x2015;Carol Field, food critic, author of <i>The Italian Baker</i><br><br>"This book will make available to a large public one of the most important culinary treatises in the history of Western cuisine."&#x2015;Fabio Parasecoli, author of <i>Food Culture in Italy</i>A noted poet, translator, and literary scholar, <b>Luigi Ballerini </b>teaches medieval and modern Italian literature at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Four years later, more than one thousand trees had been officially nominated to the project and many others suggested for possible inclusion. The results, presented in this elegant, four-color volume, are astounding. Hugo and Kirwan, the project coordinators, have selected a sample of trees and "tree places" that illustrate the enormous variety, startling beauty, and fascinating history of Virginia&#x2019;s trees.</p> <p>Here you will see, through Llewellyn&#x2019;s incomparable lens, not only some of Virginia&#x2019;s largest trees, including a newly discovered national champion overcup oak in Isle of Wight County, but also some of the state&#x2019;s oldest, including baldcypress trees over 800 years old in Southampton County and red cedars over 450 years old in Giles. You will find unique trees like a willow oak in which a tricycle is embedded, fine specimens like the massive American beech in front of Sleepy Hollow Methodist Church in Falls Church, and outrageously shaped trees, like the water tupelos in the Cypress Bridge area of Southampton County. You will find trees associated with famous people and events as well as trees associated with ordinary people in extraordinary ways. Perhaps best of all, you will learn about communities that have gone to great lengths to protect their trees and about places where the public can visit some of the best trees and "treescapes" in the state. </p> <p> <i>Remarkable Trees of Virginia</i> is a celebration of trees, but it doesn&#x2019;t dodge hard issues. In a section on urban forests, the authors describe the major problems facing trees in urban areas and point out strategies urban foresters are using to solve them. They describe the ecological services trees provide and issue a call for action both to protect trees in their existing habitats and to find more places where trees can "grow large and long."</p> <p>Hugo, Kirwan, and Llewellyn present a treasury of Virginia&#x2019;s trees that is, indeed, remarkable.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Nancy Ross Hugo is a lecturer and outdoor writer whose articles have appeared in Horticulture, Fine Gardening, American Forests, Virginia Forests, Country Journal, and other publications.

While each of these is interesting in its own ways, and together they cover a good deal of ground, none of them is very new. Thus none could take advantage of recent work on many important philosophers and periods and bring into a consideration of the past the best concepts and principles that have been developed by present-day philosophy.<br><br> In <i>Aesthetics from Classical Greece to the Present</i> the author seeks to bring these principles to the forefront in exploring the history of aesthetics.</p><p>At once a treatise for professionals and a guide for newcomers to the subject, Aesthetics is ideal both as an introductory survey of the literature on theories of art and beauty from earliest times to the present and as a text for courses in the philosophy of art. The author examines all major aspects of Western aesthetic thought, and a third of the book focuses specifically on 19th-and-20th century aesthetic theory.<p>&#x201c;For those of us who want to know what philosophers have said about beauty and the arts, this book will be especially useful.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<i>Philosophical Review</i></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Beardsley&#x2019;s book accomplishes to perfection what the writer intended.&nbsp; It illuminates an area of history from a certain perspective as was never done before. . . .

But his most daring writing took place in the shadows. Thrown into prison for his atheism in 1749, Diderot decided to reserve his best books for posterity--for us, in fact. In the astonishing cache of unpublished writings left behind after his death, Diderot challenged virtually all of his century's accepted truths, from the sanctity of monarchy, to the racial justification of the slave trade, to the norms of human sexuality. One of Diderot's most attentive readers during his lifetime was Catherine the Great, who not only supported him financially, but invited him to St. Petersburg to talk about the possibility of democratizing the Russian empire.<br><br>In this thematically organized biography, Andrew S. Curran vividly describes Diderot's tormented relationship with Rousseau, his curious correspondence with Voltaire, his passionate affairs, and his often iconoclastic stands on art, theater, morality, politics, and religion. But what this book brings out most brilliantly is how the writer's personal turmoil was an essential part of his genius and his ability to flout taboos, dogma, and convention.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of January 2019:</strong> Sometimes you stumble upon a book and think, <em>Why didn&#x2019;t I know about this before now? </em> In <em>Diderot and the Art of Thinking Freely</em>, Andrew Curran&#x2019;s spirited biography, Diderot emerges from the page as not just an Enlightenment philosopher, a contemporary of Rousseau and Voltaire, and the lead writer of the <em>Encyclop�die</em>&#x2014;he also steps out as a truly free thinker and master of dissent, even for today&#x2019;s times. Although he had many followers, including Catherine the Great, Diderot chose, probably wisely, to record some of his most provocative thoughts in unpublished novels. Author Curran uncovers these writings for us, sifting through Diderot&#x2019;s thoughts and arguments, adding context, and sweeping us up in Diderot&#x2019;s words, his times, and his ideas. It is a relatively fun read and a fascinating journey. For a philosopher living during the Enlightenment, Denis Diderot sure was a Renaissance man. &#x2014;<em>Chris Schluep, Amazon Book Review</em><p><strong>Andrew S.

Building on their research from The Leadership Challenge, James Kouzes and Barry Posner explore in Credibility why leadership is above all a relationship, with credibility as the cornerstone, and why leaders must "Say what you mean and mean what you say." This first full revision of the book since its initial publication in 1993 features new case studies from around the world, fully updated data and research, and a streamlined format. Written by the premier leadership experts working today, Credibility: </p><ul><li>Reveals the six key disciplines that strengthen a leader's capacity for developing and sustaining credibility. </li><li>Provides rich examples of real managers in action</li><li>Includes updates to?the applications?and research</li></ul><p>This personal, inspiring, and genuine guide helps you understand the fundamental importance of credibility for building personal and organizational success.</p></p><p><br><br> <strong> Q&amp;A with Authors Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner </strong><br><table> <tbody><tr> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Author Jim Kouzes </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <b>Why is credibility so important? </b><br> Credibility is the foundation of leadership: This is the inescapable conclusion we have come to after more than thirty years of research into the dynamics of the relationship between leaders and constituents. Leadership is a relationship. You can't talk about leadership without talking about the expectations of those who are led. The three qualities people most look for and admire in leaders&#x2014;that they be honest, competent, and inspiring&#x2014;are the qualities that comprise what communication researchers refer to as source credibility. Simply put, people won't believe the message if the don't believe in the messenger. <br><br> <b>Once credibility is lost, is it possible to gain it back? </b><br><br> Yes, it is. But first, let's remind ourselves that despite everyone's best intentions, despite the pursuit of flawless leadership, things don't always go as planned, expected, or promised. Sometimes circumstances change, and you can no longer do what you said you would do. Sometimes you realize, probably belatedly, that you don't have the competence or resources to do what you said. Sometimes you and others make errors in judgment or choose the wrong strategies. Sometimes you just mess up. No human being is exempt from failure. The trouble is that leadership failures and human frailties can sometimes seriously damage your credibility. That's why it's important to understand what you can do to regain credibility if ever you should tarnish or lose it. <br><br> Once that happens, you need to follow what we call the Six A's of Leadership Accountability: Accept, Admit, Apologize, Act, Amend, and Attend. When people are asked what's the most important thing a leader should do after making a mistake, the universal response is &#x201c;admit it.&#x201d; First, you have to accept personal responsibility for your actions, and, in the case of leaders, the actions of your organization. Then you have to publicly acknowledge that you have made a mistake. Offering an apology is another important step in rebuilding credibility. It lets constituents know that you are concerned about the impact your actions may have had on them, as well as the problems your actions may have caused them. Quick action to deal with the immediate consequences of a mistake needs to follow an apology. A quick response lets others know that you are going to do something about the problem. Making amends for mistakes is also a necessary but often overlooked part of the rebuilding process. People don't expect you to resign for an honest error or lapse in judgment, but they do expect some form of reparation or personal participation in the hardship. The amends should fit the problem. And finally, to make sure that you are attuned to the influence your actions are having on restoring lost credibility, you should pay close attention to the reactions of your constituents. <br><br> <b>This is the first true revision of <i>Credibility</i> since its initial publication in 1993.

The late 1980s and early 1990s were also a period of recession&#x2014;there were few jobs, we were also recovering from a market crash, and we had begun the Gulf War. Public faith in its leaders was low. In the late nineties and at the turn of the century, we saw increases in trust, confidence, and credibility among leaders of major institutions. But these shifts turned out to be very short-lived. After rising for a decade, confidence in institutions and leaders began to slide in the early 2000s, and by 2007 trust (the key ingredient of credibility) had taken a nosedive. Whatever gains had been achieved had been lost. People doubted the competence of leaders, and they also questioned their integrity. Scandals, financial misdeeds, and greed had taken their toll on people's belief in their leaders. And when the economic collapse and subsequent recession hit in 2007-2008, cynicism and distrust soared. We may have hit bottom again, but it's too soon to tell. <br><br> Leaders need to take more seriously the importance of earning and sustaining credibility. We revised this book because we want to offer a useful framework and practical suggestions on what leaders can do to increase the trust and confidence others have in them. We won't see increases in engagement or performance until we see significant increases in leader credibility. <br><br> <b>What is different in this new edition? (Or, what can fans of the first edition of <i>Credibility</i> expect from this new edition?) </b><br> This new edition of <i>Credibility</i> is completely revised and has a longer and broader reach than the earlier book. Our research is global, and the cases in this edition reflect that. From Asia and Australia to Europe, the Middle East, and North and South America, we show how people around the world affirm that credibility is the foundation of leadership. All the cases in this book have been updated, and 90 percent of them are new to this volume. They are fresh illustrations of the changing nature of the context in which people now work, especially as new generations enter the workforce. <br><br> This second edition is also slimmed down from the original. In addition to the worthy goal of saving the planet some paper, we trimmed the length for several reasons. First, we sharpened the focus on our central theme: how leaders earn and sustain credibility. In the first edition, we took detours into issues of service quality, for example, which, while important, weren't directly on message. Second, technology now allows us to move some of our research to our website. Third, we developed an entirely new companion volume to accompany this book. <i>Strengthening Credibility: A Leader&#x2019;s Workbook</i> provides many developmental and application exercises for building and sustaining credibility. <br><br> What has not changed is our intense interest in how values clarification and culture creation must be at the top of a leader&#x2019;s agenda. Some of our earliest research clearly shows that commitment, satisfaction, productivity, and other positive outcomes are significantly higher when people shared the values of their organizations. This finding is reaffirmed in our most current studies. <br><p>"<i>Credibility</i> is the most timely and important issue of our age. And with this book, based on a solid foundation of research plus their years of experience, Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner have thrown us a Hail Mary pass that can help to restore confidence and trust in our institutions. I am personally grateful to receive their pass. I bet that you will be too."<br> &#x2015;<b>Warren Bennis</b>, Distinguished Professor of Business, University of Southern California; author, <i>Still Surprised: A Memoir of a Life in Leadership</i></p> <p>"My first suggestion on how to build your credibility: read this book and apply what you learn! Nothing is more important to a leader than credibility. Jim and Barry do a wonderful job of showing us all why it matters, how to earn it, and how to keep it! Another amazing contribution from the world's authorities on leadership!"<br> &#x2015;<b>Marshall Goldsmith</b>, author, <i>MOJO</i> and <i>What Got You Here Won't Get You There</i></p> <p>"<i>Credibility</i> should be on the must-read list for all leaders and potential leaders, and should be a required text for all business majors. Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner clearly outline the values and traits of credible leaders, and they both confirm and support the theory that we all want to work for 'credible' leaders. It is a fantastic read for all of us who aspire to be the leader that others want to follow."<br> &#x2015;<b>Ann Rhoades</b>, author, <i>Built on Values</i>; president and founder, People Ink</p> <p>"Over the past twenty-five years, Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner have built&#x2015;no exaggeration&#x2015;the most significant body of leadership work on the planet. Credibility is a masterpiece because it accomplishes the seemingly impossible: it boils the vast, often-complicated and confusing act of leadership down to its purest essence and then teaches us how to put it into practice in all aspects of our lives. Simply put, this book will not only inspire you to make a difference, it will help you do it."<br> &#x2015;<b>Steve Farber</b>, author, <i>The Radical Leap Re-Energized</i> and <i>Greater Than Yourself</i>; president, Extreme Leadership, Inc.</p> <p>"When I graduated from business school back in the early 1980s, I thought I had to be a 'superhuman' if I were to ever be a CEO some day. After two dozen years of being a CEO, I now know that it's not about being superhuman; it's instead about being a super human. If there's one leadership book that is the operating manual for how to be a super leader and a super human at the same time, it is Credibility.

Eldredge is Hall Distinguished Professor of American Art and Culture at the University of Kansas. He is former director of the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the Spencer Museum of Art in Lawrence, Kansas. He is author of numerous books, including &#34;Tales from the Easel: American Narrative Paintings&#34;.Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Georgia O'Keefe, Robert Henri and John Sloan were among the artists who flocked to the art colonies of Taos and Santa Fe. Drawing inspiration from the Indians of the pueblos and their perceived harmony with nature, these painters forged new directions in American art. Hartley sought archetypal images of America that would give birth to a "sturdier realism." Marin confronted the elemental forces of sky, sea, mountain and plain in a slashing Cubist style. O'Keeffe borrowed Hispanic images of skulls and crosses in stark meditations on death. Based on an exhibition at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American Art, this arresting, illustrated volume unravels the mystique of the New Mexico school. The artists' glorification of Indian life, their use of stereotypes in depicting Hispanic culture, are analyzed in the context of fieldwork by anthropologists and photographers, the exploitive commercialism of the tourist trade and the Federal government's suppression of pueblo culture. Included in the survey are early traditionalists such as Ernest Blumenschein and modernist experimenters like Victor Higgins whose shimmering crystalline landscapes bring mountain and mesa to life. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hamlet (Shakespeare, Pelican)</h2><p>Commentary by actors, directors, and critics accompanies the text of the most popular of the Shakespearian tragedies</p><p>This edition tells the story of Hamlet in production, from Burbage at the Globe to Branagh on film, relating stage interpretations to developments in the theatre, in literary criticism and in society.

Scott</p><p>In 1922, F. Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write "something <i>new</i>--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple + intricately patterned." That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel became <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, <i>Gatsby</i> captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings. "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--" Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.<p> It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. "Her voice is full of money," Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted, and written in crystalline prose, <i>The Great Gatsby</i> is as perfectly satisfying as the best kind of poem.</p>This critical edition of The Great Gatsby draws on the manuscript and surviving proofs of the novel, together with Fitzgerald&#39;s subsequent revisions to key passages to provide the first authoritative text of one of the classic works of the twentieth century.</p><h2>Poetry in Theory: An Anthology 1900-2000</h2><p><i>Poetry in Theory: An Anthology 1900-2000</i> brings together key critical and theoretical texts from the twentieth century which have animated debates about modern poetry. <ul> <li>Helps readers to think critically about the nature of modern poetry, and to engage with broader questions about aesthetics, language, culture and imagination.</li> <li>Includes texts by poets, critics, theorists and philosophers, ranging from Ezra Pound to Jacques Derrida.</li> <li>Texts in translation from French, German, Spanish, Italian and Russian are presented alongside the work of writers from Britain, Ireland, the United States, Africa, India and the Caribbean.</li> <li>Each text is accompanied by a brief biographical and thematic introduction.</li> <li>A system of cross-referencing points up significant connections and disagreements between the texts.</li> <li>Includes a thematic index and chronology.</li> </ul></p><p>Poetry in Theory: An Anthology 1900-2000 brings together key critical and theoretical texts from the twentieth century which have animated debates about modern poetry.

That such a text existed passed largely unnoticed until a French archeologist, traveling among the monasteries of Mount Athos, came across some painters at work in the monastery of Esphigmenou who showed him the text that they were using. A copy was made resulting in the first, albeit erroneous, publication in German in 1955. A correct edition, source unknown, was published in 1909, which has been accepted as the standard since then. This current English edition is from the 1909 Greek text and has attempted to be faithful not only in context but in appearance and layout. </p><p>We are fortunate to know as much about the man who compiled this <i>Hermeneia</i> which bears his name as we do. Dionysus was born about 1670 in the village of Fourna in central Greece. At sixteen, he went to Mount Athos, and from the early years of the century became established as a painter. In Karyes (on Mount Athos), he built a <i>kellion</i> (cell) and chapel dedicated to John the Baptist, which he himself painted. Between 1724-1728 he was back in his native village of fourna, and painted the interior of the church of the Transfiguration there. He is last known to have been alive in 1744. </p><p>The date of Dionysius' compilation of the <i>Painter's Manual</i> is probably of his second period on Mount Athos, that is, 1730-1734. While he is known to have painted icons in several locations, his stature as an artist must always have been exceeded by his other gifts, and the interest of these works lies in their relationship to the literary works of their creator.</p></p><p>Paul Hetherington, the translator of this Greek text, is an historian in England, a researcher of byzantine topics and a student of classic materials. Dionysius of Fourna was a monk of the Greek Church, living on Mt. Athos, and an excellent master iconographer. His icon paintings are still very much admired both on Mt. Athos and in several cities in Greece.Text: English, Greek (translation)</p><h2>The Last Samurai: The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori</h2><p>The dramatic arc of Saigo Takamori's life, from his humble origins as a lowly samurai, to national leadership, to his death as a rebel leader, has captivated generations of Japanese readers and now Americans as well - his life is the inspiration for a major Hollywood film, <i>The Last Samurai</i>, starring Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe. In this vibrant new biography, Mark Ravina, professor of history and Director of East Asian Studies at Emory University, explores the facts behind Hollywood storytelling and Japanese legends, and explains the passion and poignancy of Saigo's life. Known both for his scholarly research and his appearances on The History Channel, Ravina recreates the world in which Saigo lived and died, the last days of the samurai. <p><i>The Last Samurai</i> traces Saigo's life from his early days as a tax clerk in far southwestern Japan, through his rise to national prominence as a fierce imperial loyalist. Saigo was twice exiled for his political activities -- sent to Japan's remote southwestern islands where he fully expected to die. But exile only increased his reputation for loyalty, and in 1864 he was brought back to the capital to help his lord fight for the restoration of the emperor. In 1868, Saigo commanded his lord's forces in the battles which toppled the shogunate and he became and leader in the emperor Meiji's new government. But Saigo found only anguish in national leadership. He understood the need for a modern conscript army but longed for the days of the traditional warrior.</p> <p>Saigo hoped to die in service to the emperor. In 1873, he sought appointment as envoy to Korea, where he planned to demand that the Korean king show deference to the Japanese emperor, drawing his sword, if necessary, top defend imperial honor. Denied this chance to show his courage and loyalty, he retreated to his homeland and spent his last years as a schoolteacher, training samurai boys in frugality, honesty, and courage. In 1876, when the government stripped samurai of their swords, Saigo's followers rose in rebellion and Saigo became their reluctant leader. His insurrection became the bloodiest war Japan had seen in centuries, killing over 12,000 men on both sides and nearly bankrupting the new imperial government. The imperial government denounced Saigo as a rebel and a traitor, but their propaganda could not overcome his fame and in 1889, twelve years after his death, the government relented, pardoned Saigo of all crimes, and posthumously restored him to imperial court rank.</p> <p>In <b>THE LAST SAMURAI</b>, Saigo is as compelling a character as Robert E. Lee was to Americans-a great and noble warrior who followed the dictates of honor and loyalty, even though it meant civil war in a country to which he'd devoted his life. Saigo's life is a fascinating look into Japanese feudal society and a history of a country as it struggled between its long traditions and the dictates of a modern future.</p></p><p>On September 24, 1877, Saig�&nbsp;Takamori, one of Japan's most loyal and honored samurai, died in the bloodiest conflict Japan had seen in over two hundred years, a battle led by Saig�&nbsp;and his band of loyal students. Now, more than 125 years after his death, Saig�&nbsp;still remains a legendary yet enigmatic figure in Japan. Why would Japan's greatest warrior, whose sole purpose was to serve his country, set in motion a civil war and lead a group of rebel soldiers to overthrow the government that he had personally helped to restore? The Last Samurai sets forth to demystify Saig�'s life, his machinations, and the dramatic historical events that shaped the life and death of Japan's favorite samurai. <p>Exiled for misconduct, Saig�&nbsp;was pardoned in 1864 and called back to the mainland to train a group of Satsuma warriors. Their mission was to seize control of the imperial palace and restore the imperial house to its former glory. Saig�'s coup was successful, and in 1867 he led the drive to destroy the shogunate and to create a powerful new state. But with Saig�'s victory came a crushing defeat: in his drive to modernize Japan, the Meiji emperor, whom Saig�&nbsp;had helped bring to power, abolished all samurai privileges, including their ancient right to carry swords.</p> <p>Now an acting member of a modernizing Meiji government, Saig�&nbsp;was given command of the new Imperial Guard, Japan's first national army in nearly a millennium. Saig�&nbsp;supported many of the government's Western-style reforms, but he was torn by the sense that he was betraying his most stalwart supporters. Deeply ambivalent about the government he had helped create, Saig�&nbsp;sought to end his career with a final dramatic gesture: he sought to go as imperial envoy to Korea, where he would insist that the Korean king recognize the Meiji emperor. When his plan was denounced as reckless, Saig�&nbsp;resigned from government, returned to his native Satsuma, and opened a military academy for former samurai warriors. His group of disgruntled students resented the rapid modernization of Japan even more than did Saig�. They set forth to slow the hand of change with their swords, making Saig�&nbsp;the reluctant leader of their uprising. Old Japan and New Japan met in battle-blades against artillery-and old Japan lost. Saig�&nbsp;died in battle from a bullet wound, but legend still has it that he died by his own sword, upholding samurai honor to the end.</p> <p>In life, Saig�&nbsp;had represented all that was commendable in the samurai estate. In death, Saig�'s legend grew even greater. The Last Samurai deftly traces the rise, fall, and rise again of Saig�'s life, his legend, and his dedication to all he believed in: tradition, honor, and glory. This compelling book provides a fascinating glimpse into the final days of Japanese feudal society, the blood-swept path of Saig�'s career, and his lasting impact on the nation to which he gave his life.</p>A brilliant warrior, reluctant rebel, and tragic figure caught between tradition and a changing world <p>0n September 24, 1877, Saigo-Takamori, one of Japan's most loyal and honored samurai, died in the bloodiest conflict Japan had seen in over two hundred years&#x2014;a battle led by Saigo- and his band of loyal students. Now, more than 125 years after his death, Saigo- still remains a legendary yet enigmatic figure in Japan. Why would Japan's greatest warrior, whose sole purpose was to serve his country, set in motion a civil war and lead a group of rebel soldiers to overthrow the government that he had personally helped to restore?</p> <p>Against the colorful and turbulent backdrop of Japanese feudal society, The Last Samurai chronicles Saigo&#x2013;'s life, from the childhood events that shaped his courage and passionate sense of justice to Saigo&#x2013;'s demise by his own hand on the battlefield of the Satsuma Rebellion. The Last Samurai offers a riveting account of the making of Japan's most honored samurai, details the tragic clash between his samurai ideals and Japan's transformation into a modern nation, and illustrates why this consummate soldier and reluctant rebel is still as revered today as he was in his time.</p> <p>"Ravina's writing grips with the intensity of a great adventure story and vividly portrays the upheavals caused to a nation."<br> &#x2014;Yorkshire Evening Post (UK)</p></p><h2>Mass Transfer: Fundamentals and Applications</h2><p>A thorough introduction to the fundamentals and applications of microscopic and macroscopic mass transfer.</p><p></p><h2>Victims of Crime</h2><p>The <strong>Fourth Edition </strong>of this widely used and respected book has been thoroughly revised and updated to include newly contributed and updated articles utilizing the latest research and studies in the areas of violence, abuse, and victims&#x2032; rights from experts in the field.

It not only places the language in its natural context but also highlights along the way key aspects of Tibetan civilization and Vajrayana Buddhism.<i> The Manual</i>, which consists of forty-one lessons, is illustrated with many drawings and photographs and also includes two informative political and linguistic maps of Tibet. Two CDs provide an essential oral complement to the manual. A detailed introduction presents a linguistic overview of spoken and written Tibetan.</p><p>When I began to study the Tibetan language, during a visit to Nepal in 1970, suitable texts for beginners were few and far between. At first I located a tattered copy of the Rev. Bruce Hannah's ancient Tibetan grammar in a used bookstand, and found to my dismay that the good pastor's illustrations of the language were entirely drawn from missionary translations of Bible stories. Not exactly the thing for a late-sixties dharma-bum! A local shopkeeper, no doubt very much amused by my efforts to communicate on this basis, took pity and provided me with a small textbook published in the Panjab, that taught me how to order tea using a level of speech suitable only for small childern, household domestics, and Khampa hillbillies. This proved to be quite adequate for the chang-stalls of BodhNath, but little more. Finally, I had the good fortune to borrow a copy of George Roerich's Textbook of Colloquial Tibetan and, given the general absence of technology in Kathmandu at the time, eagerly set about transcribing the entire book by hand. Though by no means ideal, the exercise proved to be a useful apprenticeship. It was only after I returned to the United States the following year that I was able to avail myself of the texts by Chang and Shefts, and by Goldstein and Nornang, works that marked the first efforts to adapt modern methods of language pedagogy to the requirements of Tibetan language instruction. <p>In the three decades that have passed since, a substantial number of contributions both to Tibetan linguistics and to Tibetan language teaching have thoroughly transformed the lay of the land, and the would-be learner of Tibetan, far from having to struggle to gain access to the merest crumb, is now more likely to suffer from an embarrassment of riches. For those who are finding it difficult to make up their minds about which course to follow, I do not hesitate to recommend Nicolas Tournadre and Sangda Dorje's excellent Manual of Standard Tibetan. Their collaboration represents the confluence of linguistic analysis of the first order with the stylistic sensibilities of a leading contemporary master of Tibetan composition. Both share a keen appreciation of an approach in which the learning of language and of culture must inform one another, with the result that this is one of those rare language textbooks that is a pleasure to read. </p><p>A Manual of Standard Tibetan emphasizes modern colloquial Tibetan as spoken in and around Lhasa, but adhering to a register that is widely used and understood. The student who masters it should have little difficulty communicating in most communities where Tibetan is spoken. The rudiments of the literary language are also thoroughly introduced, making it possible to make rapid progress in either Classical Tibetan or Modern Literary Tibetan during the second year of study. The cultural background incorporated in the entertaining dialogues and texts given throughout the book will prove invaluable to all who wish to enter the rich and endlessly fascinating sphere of Tibetan civilization, whether they do so as scholars, casual visitors, or in connection with work in development or in commerce. </p><p>It is often said that learning a language begins one's exploration of an entire new world. Rare, however, is the language course that succeeds in conveying the sense of excitement and discovery thus promised. In A Manual of Standard Tibetan you will find yourself transported to monastery courtyards and to nomad camps; and, though Tibetan remains always a challenging language requiring discipline and effort to learn, the rough journey in this case turns out to be a genuine delight. - Matthew T.

Say the name. What do you think of? Intellect? Scholarship? Ancient religions? Temple worship? The study of civilizations? Surely, but there&#39;s more. Brother Nibley has a keen sense of humor. And he turns a pithy phrase as no one else can. Here in one volume are many of the most entertaining and also the deepest of Brother Nibley&#39;s thoughts on society, science, education, Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon and other sacred writings, the temple, sustaining church leaders, and many other topics. These are not hte jottings of some stuffy scholar. These are gems of thought - terse, humorous, wry, and profound - clothed in a language that is so distinctly Hugh Nibley. What emerges from the quotations is the portrait of a rare philosopher - a thinker with the mind of a scholar and the heart of a believer. --- from book&#39;s back cover</p><p></p><h2>Taking an Honest and Spiritual Inventory Participant&#39;s Guide 2: A Recovery Program Based on Eight Principles from the Beatitudes (Celebrate Recovery)</h2><p><p>The <em>Celebrate Recovery Participant&#x2019;s Guides</em> are essential tools for the personal recovery journey.&nbsp; In the five lessons in <strong>Guide 2: <em>Taking an Honest and Spiritual Inventory</em></strong>, you will experience an in-depth look at the 4th principle in the recovery process:</p><p>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>O</strong>penly examine and confess my faults to God, to myself, and to someone I trust. <em>"Happy are the pure in heart"</em> (Matthew 5:8).</p><p>By working through the lessons and exercises found in each of the four Participant&#x2019;s Guides you will begin to experience the true peace and serenity you have been seeking, restore and develop stronger relationships with others and with God, and find freedom from life's hurts, hang-ups, and habits.</p><p>All the scriptures have been updated to the new NIV 2011 version.</p></p><p><p>John Baker is the founder of Celebrate Recovery�, a ministry started at Saddleback Church.

Key political, diplomatic, social, and military issues were at stake as Robert E. Lee and George B. McClellan faced off on the peninsula between the York and James Rivers. The climactic clash came on June 26-July 1 in what became known as the Seven Days battles, when Lee, newly appointed as commander of the Confederate forces, aggressively attacked the Union army. Casualties for the entire campaign exceeded 50,000, more than 35,000 of whom fell during the Seven Days. <br><br>This book offers nine essays in which well-known Civil War historians explore questions regarding high command, strategy and tactics, the effects of the fighting upon politics and society both North and South, and the ways in which emancipation figured in the campaign.

At once a bracingly honest account of ruinous attachment and a profound meditation on human suffering, <i>De Profundis</i> is a classic of gay literature. Richard Ellmann calls <i>De Profundis</i> "a love letter...One of the greatest, and the longest, ever written."<br>This Modern Library Paperback Classics edition contains newly commissioned notes.</p><p>"Displays the insight, honesty, and unself-conscious style of a great writer."<br>--W.

He studied at Yale and at Trinity College in Dublin. He taught at Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, Emory, the University of Chicago, Indiana University, and Oxford, where he was Goldsmiths' Professor of English Literature and Fellow of New College.

I find especially refreshing the way the authors 'cluster' the research traditions, which provides a sound, logical, and fluid way of understanding and applying them. The chapters offer reader-friendly, practical tips in a largely jargon-free writing style that helps to guide the reader through the decisions and dilemmas inherent in a qualitative approach."--Thomas Schram, PhD, Department of Education, University of New Hampshire<br><br>"This text offers a solid overview of qualitative methods and recognizes the work of major authors in this area. The attention to diverse research traditions will be very helpful to novice researchers, as will the emphasis on helping students develop their own projects, which fits how the research courses in our program are taught. The perspectives, activities, and Wild Cards throughout the chapters reinforce this purpose. Chapters on data collection, analysis, and writing present an array of techniques, strategies, and firsthand accounts to help students work through this process and think critically about their own work. I would use this text and will recommend it to others."--Cray Mulder, PhD, LMSW, School of Social Work, Grand Valley State University, Michigan<br><br>"Written in an accessible and manageable style for graduate students, advanced undergraduates, or professionals, this book makes excellent use of examples throughout. Readers will be especially interested in the examples the authors bring from their personal research agendas. I really like the discussion of the different purposes of research (basic, applied, action, evaluation), since qualitative research methods texts often neglect to discuss the usefulness of qualitative methods to basic research. The book does a good job of educating readers about why qualitative research is just as rigorous and as valuable as quantitative research. Although primarily targeted toward clinical and educational researchers, this book will be useful for any social scientist who wants to acquire a rich understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of qualitative research."--Lisa Harrison, PhD, Department of Psychology, California State University, Sacramento<br><br>"This book provides the groundwork for understanding the paradigms and tensions of qualitative inquiry and for building skills in research design, methods, and analysis. Integrated throughout are real-world examples and activities that clearly inform and demystify the process of qualitative research. The graphs, concept maps, quotes from qualitative researchers, and examples are very congruent to what one would find in a qualitative research study. I especially liked the examples of coding, developing themes, and handling data; the authors have done an amazing job."--Kathleen Burns-Jager, PhD, LMFT, former director, Michigan State University Family and Child Clinic<br><br>"This book is interesting, informative, and worthy of class adoption. The chapters are user friendly and easy to read, including clear definitions and explanations. The hands-on activities and exercises, case examples, and helpful hints will be helpful to students' comprehension."--Ruth Chao, PhD, Morgridge College of Education, University of Denver<br><br>"This is one of the more readable qualitative texts I've seen.

The chapters are well presented, with plenty of examples and activities for in-class use, group discussions, and reflexive journaling. The use of the scientist-practitioner model is a particularly good way of framing the research endeavor for clinicians."--Rajeswari Natrajan-Tyagi, PhD, Marriage and Family Therapy Program, California School of Professional Psychology, Alliant International University<br></p><br><br>"Two innovative writers concentrate here on many aspects of qualitative research which are of primary importance, yet which seldom seem to feature in other texts or part-texts on this topic. For that reason, I envisage that supervisors who discover this text will wish to encourage their research students to immerse themselves in their own personal copies. The writers are researchers who have been closely associated since their doctoral studies, and wish to take their readers on a rewarding journey into what they have learnt about qualitative analysis on the way. They are engaged in, and seek to advise those engaged in, qualitative studies of human conditions and behaviour, within clinical and educational settings....Perhaps because of their wider scope, the shared personal experience, advice and thinking offered to readers forms an especially deep and insightful source for all qualitative researchers....I treasure a few books on my shelves for the wisdom which their writers have made available to me. This text will join that small collection. It is unique, however, in that the wisdom these writers have accrued on the journey they invite us to retrace with them hasastonishinglybeen accrued in a relatively short professional career."

For answers, you need insight into the Bible's culture, its people and how they lived.</p><p>What people wore, what they ate, what they built, how they exercised justice, how they mourned, how they viewed family and legal customs-all are "manners and customs" and all vary from period to period throughout Israel's history.</p><p>Fortunately, this book is a lot more than just nice pictures-although there are a lot of those, too. Each chapter furnishes an introduction to the political and physical setting of the period in Israel's history and outlines the basic structure of its social world. Then specific scenes drawn from the biblical text are studied in a way that sheds light on the daily life of the people of that time. Drawing from a variety of sources to recreate the society of ancient Israel-extrabiblical sources and archaeological data as well as the biblical text itself-Dr. Matthews helps the reader to see the ancient world of Israel as never before. Once seen in this way, it will never look the same again.</p><p>Now in a new, revised edition, Dr. Matthews offers even more helpful insights into the biblical world. Over a hundred Scripture passages have been placed alongside the text to complement the discussion and to keep the relevant biblical passages in view. More than twenty new illustrations and photos help to give an even better "feel" for the world of Abraham, David, Jesus, and Paul.</p></p><p>Victor H. Matthews is professor of religious studies at Southwestern Missouri State University. He received a Ph.D. from Brandeis University and has written numerous popular as well as scholarly articles. He is the author of <i>Manners and Customs in the Bible,</i> and co-author of <i>Old Testament Parallels: Laws and Stories from the Ancient Near East,</i> and <i>The Social World of Ancient Israel.</i><p></p></p><h2>The Manga Guide to Physiology (Manga Guides)</h2><p>Student nurse Kumiko has just flunked her physiology exam and has one last shot at passing her makeup test.

Charged under an obscure blasphemy law in a small New Jersey town in 1919, Vijay Sahni is challenged by a skeptical judge to defend his belief that the certainty of mathematics can be extended to all human knowledge--including religion. Together, the two men discover the power--and the fallibility--of what has long been considered the pinnacle of human certainty, Euclidean geometry.</p><br><p> As grandfather and grandson struggle with the question of whether there can ever be absolute certainty in mathematics or life, they are forced to reconsider their fundamental beliefs and choices. Their stories hinge on their explorations of parallel developments in the study of geometry and infinity--and the mathematics throughout is as rigorous and fascinating as the narrative and characters are compelling and complex.</p><br><p> Moving and enlightening, <i>A Certain Ambiguity</i> is a story about what it means to face the extent--and the limits--of human knowledge.</p></p><p><p>"<i>A Certain Ambiguity</i> is an amazing narrative that glows with a vivid sense of the beauty and wonder of mathematics. The narrator is deeply troubled by the ancient question of whether the objects and theorems of mathematics have a reality independent of human minds. Mixing fiction with nonfiction, <i>A Certain Ambiguity</i> is a veritable history of mathematics disguised as a novel. Starting with the Pythagorean theorem, it moves through number theory and geometry to Cantor's alephs, non-Euclidean geometry, G�del, and even relativity."--Martin Gardner</p><p>"This is a truly captivating thriller that will take you on a whirlwind tour to infinity--and beyond. But be warned: once you start reading, you won't be able to put it aside until finished! A masterly-told story that weaves together criminal law, ancient and modern history, a young man's quest to know his deceased grandfather-and some highly intriguing mathematics."--Eli Maor, author of <i>e: the Story of a Number</i> and <i>The Pythagorean Theorem: A 4,000-Year History</i></p><p>"This rich and engaging novel follows the path that leads one young person to become a professional mathematician. By deftly blending the young man's story with mathematical ideas and historical developments in the subject, the authors succeed brilliantly in taking the reader on a tour of some of the major highlights in the philosophy of mathematics. If that were not enough, the book also examines, through the minds of its characters, the natures of faith (religious and other) and truth. I am strongly thinking of building a university non-majors math course around this novel."--Keith Devlin, Stanford University, author of <i>The Math Gene</i></p><p>"<i>A Certain Ambiguity</i> is a remarkably good effort to work through some fundamental issues in the philosophy of mathematics in the context of a novel. Crucial to the success of such a venture is creating characters and a plot that are strong enough to hold a reader's interest.

Eight new paintings extend nearly four hundred feet to form a 360-degree experience encircling an entire floor of the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C. Bradford&#x2019;s monumental installation is inspired by the 1883 cyclorama painted by Paul Philippoteaux to commemorate the Battle of Gettysburg, which has been considered the critical turning point of the Civil War and, consequently, of American history. Elements from Philippoteaux&#x2019;s paintings are among multiple layers of collaged paper that Bradford has scraped through to reveal hidden textures and complexities, and this interplay&#x2014;between past and present, between the legible and the mysteriously evocative&#x2014;encourages a reconsideration of history&#x2019;s conventional linear narratives. The catalogue features an interview with the artist by St�phane Aquin and an essay by Evelyn Hankins that situates the site-specific project within a broader art historical context. With lavish images of the paintings and their installation, including two gatefolds, this book records a significant new contribution to socially engaged American art.</p><p>This beautifully illustrated book documents a monumental and timely project by the renowned contemporary artist, inviting readers to draw connections to history while rethinking its conventional linear narratives.<br> &nbsp;<p><b>St�phane Aquin</b> is chief curator and <b>Evelyn Hankins</b> is curator at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.</p></p><h2>Visit from the Goon Squad</h2><p>Jennifer Egan&#39;s spellbinding novel circles the lives of Bennie Salazar, an aging former punk rocker and record executive, and Sasha, the passionate, troubled young woman he employs. Although Bennie and Sasha never discover each other&#39;s pasts, the reader does, in intimate detail, along with the secret lives of a host of other characters whose paths intersect with theirs, over many years, in locales as varied as New York, San Francisco, Naples, and Africa. We first meet Sasha in her mid-thirties, on her therapist&#39;s couch in New York City, confronting her longstanding compulsion to steal. Later, we learn the genesis of her turmoil when we see her as the child of a violent marriage, then a runaway living in Naples, then as a college student trying to avert the suicidal impulses of her best friend. We meet Bennie Salazar at the melancholy nadir of his adult life - divorced, struggling to connect with his nine-year-old son, listening to a washed up band in the basement of a suburban house - and then revisit him in 1979, at the height of his youth, shy and tender, reveling in San Francisco&#39;s punk scene as he discovers his ardor for rock and roll and his gift for spotting talent. We learn what became of his high school gang - who thrived and who faltered - and we encounter Lou Kline, Bennie&#39;s catastrophically careless mentor, along with the lovers and children left behind in the wake of Lou&#39;s far flung sexual conquests and meteoric rise and fall. &#34;A Visit from the Goon Squad&#34; is a book about the interplay of time and music, about survival, about the stirrings and transformations set inexorably in motion by even the most passing conjunction of our fates. In a breathtaking array of styles and tones ranging from tragedy to satire to Powerpoint, Egan captures the undertow of self-destruction that we all must either master or succumb to; the basic human hunger for redemption; and the universal tendency to reach for both - and escape the merciless progress of time - in the transporting realms of art and music. Sly, startling, exhilarating work from one of our boldest writers.</p><p>Jennifer Egan is the author of The Keep, Look at Me, The Invisible Circus, and the story collection Emerald City. Her stories have been published in The New Yorker, Harper&#39;s Magazine, GQ, Zoetrope, All-Story, and Ploughshares, and her nonfiction appears frequently in The New York Times Magazine. She lives with her husband and sons in Brooklyn.Chapter 1<br><br>Found Objects<br><br>It began the usual way, in the bathroom of the Lassimo Hotel. Sasha was adjusting her yellow eye shadow in the mirror when she noticed a bag<br><br>on the floor beside the sink that must have belonged to the woman<br><br>whose peeing she could faintly hear through the vaultlike door of a toilet stall. Inside the rim of the bag, barely visible, was a wallet made of pale green leather. It was easy for Sasha to recognize, looking back, that the peeing woman's blind trust had provoked her: <i>We live in a city where people will steal the hair off your head if you give them half a chance, but you leave your stuff lying in plain sight and expect it to be waiting for you when you come back?</i> It made her want to teach the woman a lesson. But this wish only camouflaged the deeper feeling Sasha always had: that at, tender wallet, offering itself to her hand-it seemed so dull, so life-as-usual to just leave it there rather than seize the moment, accept the challenge, take the leap, fly the coop, throw caution to the wind, live dangerously ("I get it," Coz, her therapist, said), and take the fucking thing.<br><br>"You mean steal it."<br><br>He was trying to get Sasha to use that word, which was harder to avoid in the case of a wallet than with a lot of the things she'd lifted over the past year, when her condition (as Coz referred to it) had begun to accelerate: five sets of keys, fourteen pairs of sunglasses, a child's striped scarf, binoculars, a cheese grater, a pocketknife, twenty-eight bars of soap, and eighty-five pens, ranging from cheap ballpoints she'd used to sign debit-card slips to the aubergine Visconti that cost two hundred sixty dollars online, which she'd lifted from her former boss's lawyer during a contracts meeting. Sasha no longer took anything from stores-their cold, inert goods didn't tempt her. Only from people.<br><br>"Okay," she said. "Steal it."<br><br>Sasha and Coz had dubbed that feeling she got the "personal challenge," as in: taking the wallet was a way for Sasha to assert her toughness, her individuality. What they needed to do was switch things around in her head so that the challenge became not taking the wallet but leaving it. That would be the cure, although Coz never used words like "cure." He wore funky sweaters and let her call him Coz, but he was old school inscrutable, to the point where Sasha couldn't tell if he was gay or straight, if he'd written famous books, or if (as she sometimes suspected) he was one of those escaped cons who impersonate surgeons and wind<br><br>up leaving their operating tools inside people's skulls. Of course, these questions could have been resolved on Google in less than a minute, but they were useful questions (according to Coz), and so far, Sasha had resisted.<br><br>The couch where she lay in his office was blue leather and very soft. Coz liked the couch, he'd told her, because it relieved them both of the burden of eye contact. "You don't like eye contact?" Sasha had asked. It seemed like a weird thing for a therapist to admit.<br><br>"I find it tiring," he'd said. "This way, we can both look where we want."<br><br>"Where will you look?"<br><br>He smiled. "You can see my options."<br><br>"Where do you usually look? When people are on the couch."<br><br>"Around the room," Coz said. "At the ceiling. Into space."<br><br>"Do you ever sleep?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>Sasha usually looked at the window, which faced the street, and tonight, as she continued her story, was rippled with rain. She'd glimpsed the wallet, tender and overripe as a peach. She'd plucked it from the woman's bag and slipped it into her own small handbag, which she'd zipped shut before the sound of peeing had stopped. She'd flicked open the bathroom door and floated back through the lobby to the bar. She and the wallet's owner had never seen each other.<br><br>Prewallet, Sasha had been in the grip of a dire evening: lame date (yet another) brooding behind dark bangs, sometimes glancing at the flat-screen TV, where a Jets game seemed to interest him more than Sasha's admittedly overhandled tales of Bennie Salazar, her old boss, who was famous for founding the Sow's Ear record label and who also (Sasha happened to know) sprinkled gold flakes into his coffee-as an aphrodisiac, she suspected-and sprayed pesticide in his armpits.<br><br>Postwallet, however, the scene tingled with mirthful possibility. Sasha felt the waiters eyeing her as she sidled back to the table holding her handbag with its secret weight. She sat down and took a sip of her Melon Madness Martini and cocked her head at Alex. She smiled her yes/no smile. "Hello," she said.<br><br>The yes/no smile was amazingly effective.<br><br>"You're happy," Alex said.<br><br>"I'm always happy," Sasha said. "Sometimes I just forget."<br><br>Alex had paid the bill while she was in the bathroom-clear proof that he'd been on the verge of aborting their date. Now he studied her. "You feel like going somewhere else?"<br><br>They stood. Alex wore black cords and a white button-up shirt. He was a legal secretary. On e-mail he'd been fanciful, almost goofy, but in person he seemed simultaneously anxious and bored. She could tell that he was in excellent shape, not from going to the gym but from being young enough that his body was still imprinted with whatever sports he'd played in high school and college. Sasha, who was thirty-five, had passed that point. Still, not even Coz knew her real age. The closest anyone had come to guessing it was thirty-one, and most put her in her twenties. She worked out daily and avoided the sun. Her online profiles all listed her as twenty-eight.<br><br>As she followed Alex from the bar, she couldn't resist unzipping her purse and touching the fat green wallet just for a second, for the contraction it made her feel around her heart.<br><br>"You're aware of how the theft makes <i>you</i> feel," Coz said. "To the point where you remind yourself of it to improve your mood. But do you think about how it makes the other person feel?"<br><br>Sasha tipped back her head to look at him. She made a point of doing this now and then, just to remind Coz that she wasn't an idiot-she knew the question had a right answer. She and Coz were collaborators, writing a story whose end had already been determined: she would get well. She would stop stealing from people and start caring again about the things that had once guided her: music; the network of friends she'd made when she first came to New York; a set of goals she'd scrawled on a big sheet of newsprint and taped to the walls of her early apartments:<br><br>Find a band to manage<br>Understand the news<br>Study Japanese<br>Practice the harp<br><br>"I don't think about the people," Sasha said.<br><br>"But it isn't that you lack empathy," Coz said. "We know that, because of the plumber."<br><br>Sasha sighed. She'd told Coz the plumber story about a month ago, and he'd found a way to bring it up at almost every session since. The plumber was an old man, sent by Sasha's landlord to investigate a leak in the apartment below hers. He'd appeared in Sasha's doorway, tufts of gray on his head, and within a minute-<i>boom</i>-he'd hit the floor and crawled under her bathtub like an animal fumbling its way into a familiar hole. The fingers he'd groped toward the bolts behind the tub were grimed to cigar stubs, and reaching made his sweatshirt hike up, exposing a soft white back. Sasha turned away, stricken by the old man's abasement, anxious to leave for her temp job, except that the plumber was talking to her, asking about the length and frequency of her showers. "I never use it," she told him curtly. "I shower at the gym." He nodded without acknowledging her rudeness, apparently used to it. Sasha's nose began to prickle; she shut her eyes and pushed hard on both temples.<br><br>Opening her eyes, she saw the plumber's tool belt lying on the floor at her feet. It had a beautiful screwdriver in it, the orange translucent handle gleaming like a lollipop in its worn leather loop, the silvery shaft sculpted, sparkling. Sasha felt herself contract around the object in a single yawn of appetite; she needed to hold the screwdriver, just for a minute. She bent her knees and plucked it noiselessly from the belt. Not a bangle jangled; her bony hands were spastic at most things, but she was good at this-<i>made for it</i>, she often thought, in the first drifty moments after lifting something. And once the screwdriver was in her hand, she felt instant relief from the pain of having an old soft-backed man snuffling under her tub, and then something more than relief: a blessed indifference, as if the very idea of feeling pain over such a thing were baffling.<br><br>"And what about after he'd gone?" Coz had asked when Sasha told him the story. "How did the screwdriver look to you then?"<br><br>There was a pause. "Normal," she said.<br><br>"Really. Not special anymore?"<br><br>"Like any screwdriver."<br><br>Sasha had heard Coz shift behind her and felt something happen in the room: the screwdriver, which she'd placed on the table (recently supplemented with a second table) where she kept the things she'd lifted, and which she'd barely looked at since, seemed to hang in the air of Coz's office. It floated between them: a symbol.<br><br>"And how did you feel?" Coz asked quietly. "About having taken it from the plumber you pitied?"<br><br>How did she feel? <i>How did she feel?</i> There was a right answer, of course. At times Sasha had to fight the urge to lie simply as a way of depriving Coz of it.<br><br>"Bad," she said. "Okay? I felt bad. Shit, I'm bankrupting myself to pay for you-obviously I get that this isn't a great way to live."<br><br>More than once, Coz had tried to connect the plumber to Sasha's father, who had disappeared when she was six. She was careful not to indulge this line of thinking. "I don't remember him," she told Coz. "I have nothing to say." She did this for Coz's protection and her own- they were writing a story of redemption, of fresh beginnings and second chances. But in that direction lay only sorrow.<br><br>Sasha and Alex crossed the lobby of the Lassimo Hotel in the direction of the street. Sasha hugged her purse to her shoulder, the warm ball of wallet snuggled in her armpit. As they passed the angular budded branches by the big glass doors to the street, a woman zigzagged into their path. "Wait," she said. "You haven't seen-I'm desperate."<br><br>Sasha felt a twang of terror. It was the woman whose wallet she'd taken-she knew this instantly, although the person before her had nothing in common with the blithe, raven-haired wallet owner she'd pictured. This woman had vulnerable brown eyes and flat pointy shoes that clicked too loudly on the marble floor. There was plenty of gray in her frizzy brown hair.<br><br>Sasha took Alex's arm, trying to steer him through the doors. She felt his pulse of surprise at her touch, but he stayed put. "Have we seen what?" he said.<br><br>"Someone stole my wallet. My ID is gone, and I have to catch a plane tomorrow morning. I'm just desperate!" She stared beseechingly at both of them. It was the sort of frank need that New Yorkers quickly learn how to hide, and Sasha recoiled. It had never occurred to her that the woman was from out of town.<br><br>"Have you called the police?" Alex asked.<br><br>"The concierge said he would call. But I'm also wondering-could it have fallen out somewhere?" She looked helplessly at the marble floor around their feet. Sasha relaxed slightly. This woman was the type who annoyed people without meaning to; apology shadowed her movements even now, as she followed Alex to the concierge's desk. Sasha trailed behind.<br><br>"Is someone helping this person?" she heard Alex ask.<br><br>The concierge was young and spiky haired. "We've called the police," he said defensively.<br><br>Alex turned to the woman. "Where did this happen?"<br><br>"In the ladies' room. I think."<br><br>"Who else was there?"<br><br>"No one."<br><br>"It was empty?"<br><br>"There might have been someone, but I didn't see her."<br><br>Alex swung around to Sasha. "You were just in the bathroom," he said. "Did you see anyone?"<br><br>"No," she managed to say. She had Xanax in her purse, but she couldn't open her purse. Even with it zipped, she feared that the wallet would blurt into view in some way that she couldn't control, unleashing a cascade of horrors: arrest, shame, poverty, death.<br><br>Alex turned to the concierge. "How come I'm asking these questions instead of you?" he said. "Someone just got robbed in your hotel. Don't you have, like, security?"<br><br>The words "robbed" and "security" managed to pierce the soothing backbeat that pumped through not just the Lassimo but every hotel like it in New York City. There was a mild ripple of interest from the lobby.<br><br>"I've called security," the concierge said, adjusting his neck. "I'll call them again."<br><br>Sasha glanced at Alex. He was angry, and the anger made him recognizable in a way that an hour of aimless chatter (mostly hers, it was true) had not: he was new to New York. He came from someplace smaller. He had a thing or two to prove about how people should treat one another.<br><br>Two security guys showed up, the same on TV and in life: beefy guys whose scrupulous politeness was somehow linked to their willingness to crack skulls. They dispersed to search the bar. Sasha wished feverishly that she'd left the wallet there, as if this were an impulse she'd barely resisted.<br><br>"I'll check the bathroom," she told Alex, and forced herself to walk slowly around the elevator bank. The bathroom was empty. Sasha opened her purse, took out the wallet, unearthed her vial of Xanax, and popped one between her teeth. They worked faster if you chewed them. As the caustic taste flooded her mouth, she scanned the room, trying to decide where to ditch the wallet: In the stall? Under the sink? The decision paralyzed her. She had to do this right, to emerge unscathed, and if she could, if she did-she had a frenzied sense of making a promise to Coz.<br><br>The bathroom door opened, and the woman walked in. Her frantic eyes met Sasha's in the bathroom mirror: narrow, green, equally frantic. There was a pause, during which Sasha felt that she was being confronted; the woman knew, had known all along. Sasha handed her the wallet. She saw, from the woman's stunned expression, that she was wrong.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: With Selected Statutes, Cases, and Other Materials, 2018</h2><p>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: With Selected Statutes, Cases, and Other Materials, 2018 Supplement</p><p></p><h2>Revising Prose</h2><p>As its title implies, this book deals with revising, not with original composition. Stressing the importance of the single sentence, The Paramedic Method of revision provides an easily learned method of revision to combat the obscurities of meaning that plague The Official Style, and demonstrates how to revise this stilted, dense prose into plain English. This book has been used with success wherever extensive writing is required, and also at every level of higher education. Addresses the specific stylistic patterns that characterize most bad writing and gives an eight-step revision method called The Paramedic Method to break those patterns and improve writing. Helps with writing tasks in business, government, and the university, where The Official Style is rampant, and provides an indispensable guide to revising in every writing context.

Sculpture, and even more painting, are concrete, sensuous, and emotional, speaking directly to all. All that was most native in architectural taste survived the periods of Chinese monumentality - huge temples and gridiron city plans - with little change.

Now it is back with a vengeance, propelled by a groundswell of populists around the world. In <i>Straight Talk on Trade</i>, Dani Rodrik, an early and outspoken critic of economic globalization taken too far, goes beyond the populist backlash and offers a more reasoned explanation for why our elites&#x2019; and technocrats&#x2019; obsession with hyper-globalization made it more difficult for nations to achieve legitimate economic and social objectives at home: economic prosperity, financial stability, and equity.</p><br><p>Rodrik takes globalization&#x2019;s cheerleaders to task, not for emphasizing economics over other values, but for practicing bad economics and ignoring the discipline&#x2019;s own nuances that should have called for caution. He makes a case for a pluralist world economy where nation-states retain sufficient autonomy to fashion their own social contracts and develop economic strategies tailored to their needs. Rather than calling for closed borders or defending protectionists, Rodrik shows how we can restore a sensible balance between national and global governance. Ranging over the recent experiences of advanced countries, the eurozone, and developing nations, Rodrik charts a way forward with new ideas about how to reconcile today&#x2019;s inequitable economic and technological trends with liberal democracy and social inclusion.</p><br><p>Deftly navigating the tensions among globalization, national sovereignty, and democracy, <i>Straight Talk on Trade</i> presents an indispensable commentary on today&#x2019;s world economy and its dilemmas, and offers a visionary framework at a critical time when we need it most.</p></p><p><p>"All economists should read <i>Straight Talk on Trade</i> to appreciate how their own models are often richer than their policy advice. And all noneconomists should read this book to appreciate how much economics has to offer on the biggest questions of growth and inequality. The length of this book belies its stunning scope, ranging from developed to developing countries, the past to the present, and political science to economics. Dani Rodrik's eclectic methodology and advice support his unwavering, optimistic belief that economic ideas can and should help people shape their destinies."<b>--Jason Furman, Harvard Kennedy School and former chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers</b></p><p>"There is a ton of erudition and not an ounce of orthodoxy in this compact, incisive book. Dani Rodrik analyzes policy like an economist and analyzes economics like a philosopher. The net effect is a disarmingly fresh and penetrating set of insights on national self-determination, fair versus free trade, and the rich interplay between markets, governments, and individual identity in sustaining stable nation-states. Arguing for a rethinking and rebalancing of the teetering project of globalization, Rodrik offers something to delight and offend every reader."<b>--David Autor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</b></p><p>"Dani Rodrik is one of the most original thinkers today on economics and development. In <i>Straight Talk on Trade</i>, he explains why there is so much discontentment with the multilateral system, and offers interesting proposals for how we might preserve what is good about it. This is a must-read for anyone interested in the roots of populist nationalism and the widespread angst in industrial societies today."<b>--Raghuram Rajan, University of Chicago</b></p><p>"<i>Straight Talk on Trade</i> presents a straightforward and readable agenda to make globalization serve democracy rather than undermine it, while avoiding the populist remedies being hawked by politicians today."<b>--Francis Fukuyama, Stanford University</b></p><p>"Amongst today's mainstream economists, there is a cottage industry of experts rationalizing the backlash against globalization. Dani Rodrik was one of the very few who warned about this backlash at least a decade in advance when the world was in thrall to the globalization fetish. A terrific guide to understanding this swinging pendulum, <i>Straight Talk on Trade</i> offers sensible suggestions on how not to love globalization if we are to preserve its many undeniable benefits."<b>--Arvind Subramanian, chief economic adviser to the Government of India</b></p><p>"<i>Straight Talk on Trade</i> looks at the possibility that the world has proceeded too hastily with globalization and emphasized globalization of the wrong kind. Dani Rodrik contends that we have neglected notions of national sovereignty at our peril, and his knowledge, sources, methods, and arguments are all first-rate and battle-tested."<b>--Tyler Cowen, author of <i>The Complacent Class</i></b></p><p>"Not many economists are able to make astute observations about economics and politics based not only on professional knowledge but also on common sense. And only a few can speak at once to the academic economist, the economics student, applied economists, and intelligent readers outside the field. In <i>Straight Talk on Trade</i>, Dani Rodrik accomplishes this and more."<b>--Ariel Rubinstein, Tel Aviv University and New York University</b></p><b>Dani Rodrik</b> is the Ford Foundation Professor of International Political Economy at the John F.

It is the outgrowth of a program of research in the systematics of cultivated plants, initiated in the late nineteenth century by Liberty Hyde Bailey and continuing today within the framework of his philosophy that knowledge in basic science should be made available to society as a whole. Hortus Third is for advanced horticulturists and others interested in cultivated plants, including horticultural and garden writers, gardeners, nurserymen, landscape architects, botanists, and professional scientists in universities, botanical gardens, extension services, and government.</p><p>Hortus Third is a book unique in the field of North American horticultural literature. Written from a botanical point of view for the horticultural community, it is a record of the astonishingly rich and diverse flora of cultivated plants of the United States, Canada, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Hortus Third is part of a longstanding program of research, initiated before the turn of the century by Liberty Hyde Bailey, that has given rise to a series of authoritative encyclopedic horticultural works, including Hortus and Hortus Second, published in 1930 and 1941 respectively. Hortus Third continues in the tradition of these publications, but it is much more than a revised or updated version. It is an essentially new work. Obsolete entries of previous editions have been omitted and have been replaced by many more entirely new entries. All other entries, with the exception of a few of the general articles, have been entirely rewritten and expanded to reflect current knowledge of the world's cultivated plants and the conceptual changes that have occurred in systematic botany over the past thirty-five years. The new system of nomenclature for the cultivated variants of species is used. Other innovations include the citation of the author or authors for each botanical name, diagnostic illustrations of representative species of most families, a glossary of botanical terms, and an index to common names. Hortus Third accounts for the botanical names of 34,305 families, genera, and species, and a large but uncounted number of subspecies, varieties, forms, and cultivars. Each entry with a description includes the correct botanical name with its author or authors and, as appropriate, botanical synonyms, common names, indication of nativity, and notes on use, propagation, and culture. Separate articles deal with important crops, such as blueberries; groups of plants&#x2014;for example, conifers; and methods and materials, such as pruning and soils. As with previous editions, Hortus Third will be for years to come the standard reference to the plants of North American horticulture.Hortus Third was written by the staff of the Liberty Hyde Bailey Hortorium of Cornell University with the collaboration of a long list of distinguished contributors. The final editing and revisions were the responsibility of the professional staff of the Hortorium, David M. Bates, John W. Incram, Jr., and Harold E. Moore, Jr.</p><h2>Don Quijote de la Mancha, I (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Presents the classic early 17th century Spanish novel of chivalry and abiding optimism, depicting the exploits of a knight who attempts to bring justice and truth to the world, with an introduction to each volume.</p><p>Hace mas de un cuarto de siglo que Ediciones Catedra publico por primera vez una edicion del &#34;&#34;Quijote&#34;&#34; en la coleccion Letras Hispanicas, a cargo del profesor John Jay Allen.

V)</h2><p>Where should we situate the British Empire in the larger picture of world history? This fifth and final volume of <em>The Oxford History of the British Empire</em> shows how opinions have changed dramatically from one generation to the next on the nature and role of imperialism generally, and the British Empire more specifically.<br> <br> In these pages, a distinguished team of scholarly contributors discuss the many and diverse elements that have influenced writings on the Empire. Topics in this vein include the pressure of current events, access to primary sources, the creation of relevant university chairs, the rise of nationalism in former colonies, decolonization, and the Cold War. The chapters aim to demonstrate how the study of empire has evolved from a narrow focus on constitutional issues to a wide-ranging, multi-faceted analysis of international relations, the uses of power, and the influences and counter-influences between settler groups and indigenous peoples. The result is a thought-provoking cultural and intellectual inquiry into our understanding of the past.<br> <em>About the Series:</em> <br> <em>The Oxford History of the British Empire</em> is a major new assessment of the Empire in the light of recent scholarship and the progressive opening of historical records. It deals with the interaction of British and non-western societies from the Elizabethan era to the late twentieth century, provides a balanced treatment of the ruled as well as the rulers, and takes into account the significance of the Empire for the peoples of the British Isles. All five of the volumes in this series fully explore economic and social as well as political trends.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robin Winks</strong> is Randolph W.

Hundreds of species - earthworms, frogs, flowers, shrubs - never descend to earth during their lifetimes. Eight out of ten remain unnamed and unclassified by science.<br>In The High Frontier, Mark W. Moffett does for the tropical rainforest canopy what Jacques Cousteau did thirty years ago for undersea life. Donning rock climbing gear to join researchers working 150 feet and more above the ground, Moffett photographed strangler trees in Borneo, giant squirrels in India, and canopy bears in Colombia. He entered the terrifying world of arboreal spiders and ants, photographing them under extreme magnification. His coverage of this new science is unparalleled in any other field.<br>Described as a "world-roving zoologist" by National Geographic magazine for his work on five continents, Moffett has documented virtually every major active canopy research site. The immediacy of his writing and the intelligence of his photography make the canopy's fantastic architecture and unearthly inhabitants accessible to the general reader. In the tradition of the great nineteenth-century explorers, he captures the struggles of the individual scientists and the passions that enable them to brave perilous situations in pursuit of their work. The High Frontier is a modern classic of scientific discovery.</p><p><b>Edward O. Wilson</b> is Pellegrino University Professor, Emeritus, at Harvard University. In addition to two Pulitzer Prizes (one of which he shares with Bert H�lldobler), Wilson has won many scientific awards, including the National Medal of Science and the Crafoord Prize of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.Scientists have only just begun to explore the biology of the tropical rainforest canopy. In <i>The High Frontier</i>, Mark W. Moffett provides an elegantly written account of the ecology of this aerial continent. The book is packed full with his stunning--and often unusual--photographs of canopy architecture, animals and plants, taken while accompanying tree-climbing researchers working at study sites worldwide. (<i>Nature</i>)<br><br>Mark Moffett's book is a magnificent exploration of the most biodiverse environment known--the rainforest canopy--supported by the finest colour photographs I have ever seen. Almost a decade has passed since I wrote <i>The Enchanted Canopy</i>...Moffett charts the explosion of new discoveries since then and the emergence of a new breed of arboreal naturalists...<i>The High Frontier</i> comprises a series of insightful encounters with scientists working in a wide range of disciplines to uncover the secrets of the canopy...The book really comes to life in the examples of how many animals and plants interact. Good journalistic narrative is at all times underpinned with first-hand knowledge and the authority of excellent research...Moffett's book is a visual feast. Some of his photographs are breathtaking...This remarkable book will be another stepping stone on the way to taking canopy science seriously. As Cousteau once predicted research stations under the sea, so I envisage, in the not-too-distant future, permanent research stations in the canopy to study the ocean of life a mere 100 feet above our heads. (Andrew Mitchell <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i>)<br><br>Moffett presents his personal vision of tropical rain-forest canopy biology, a science in its infancy; it is a product of Moffett's trips to five continents, where he interviewed and worked alongside scores of the tree-climbing biologists who are exploring this unique and rapidly vanishing terrain. The result is a stunning mixture of adventure, nature photography and hard scientific inquiry that ranks with the best work of Jacques Cousteau. (Robert Crawford <i>Boston Globe</i>)<br><br>Moffett's own research has often been financed by <i>The National Geographic</i>, and a single glance at this beautiful, large-format book shows why. He is a superb photographer, able to capture, while dangling from a rope or balanced on a branch, vignettes of life at the top...[Moffett] says that he hopes people will see, from his book, that these environments are so rich, so valuable, that they will be moved to protect them. I only hope that this is true.

The book offers a unique balance of theory and clear-cut choices for customizing every phase of a qualitative study. A scholarly mix of classic and contemporary studies from multiple disciplines provides compelling, field-based examples of the full range of qualitative approaches. Readers learn about adaptive ways of designing studies, collecting data, analyzing data, and reporting findings. Key aspects of the researcher's craft are addressed, such as fieldwork options, the five phases of data analysis (with and without using computer-based software), and how to incorporate the researcher's ";declarative"; and ";reflective"; selves into a final report.&nbsp;Ideal for graduate-level courses, the text includes:* Discussions of ethnography, grounded theory, phenomenology, feminist research, and other approaches.* Instruc</p><p><p> &nbsp;</p><b>Robert K.

I found other characteristics particularly useful to my teaching of doctoral students....Yin's...approach included an &#x2018;adaptive&#x2019; perspective so that the reader could adapt elements from the book to their own study....Another feature that might be helpful for novice researchers and/or doctoral students was Yin's...description of and resources for completing the literature review....An exciting addition to the list of sources available for the new researcher....Within [his] linear, clear sequencing, Yin offered multiple options and reasons for choosing certain options (or choosing other options), encouraging researchers to do the same. The writing style was clear, concise and not jargon-loaded, which also might appeal to the novice researcher....I connected with Yin's work as a researcher and as a teacher.&#x201d; (<i>Qualitative Report</i> 2011-11-01)</p><h2>Schaum&#39;s Outline of Spanish Grammar, 6th Edition (Schaum&#39;s Outlines)</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><p><b>Tough Test Questions?

She was already celebrated and a published writer, whereas he, though ambitious, was unknown. This compelling dual biography tells the extraordinary story of their union and disunion, set against a European background of momentous events and dramatic social and cultural change. Renee Winegarten offers new perspectives on each of the protagonists, revealing their rare qualities and their all-too-human failings as well as the complex nature of their debt to one another.</p><p>Their passionate and productive relationship endured on and off for seventeen years. Winegarten traces their story largely through their own words&#x2014;letters and autobiographical writings&#x2014;and illuminates the deep intellectual and visceral bond they shared despite disparate personalities and gifts. Exploring their relationships with Napoleon and the Bourbons, their different responses to the momentous upheavals of postrevolutionary France, their support of individual liberty with order, and more, the book concludes with an appreciation of de Sta�l&#x2019;s and Constant&#x2019;s singular contributions to a new literature and to the history of liberty.</p></p><p><p>Renee Winegarten is a writer and literary critic who publishes frequently on French literature and civilization.

She lives in England.</p><p> Reviewed by Margot Livesey</p><p> Perhaps our tumultuous times have something to do with the enduring popularity of World War II as subject matter for both books and films. In recent years, novelists such as Richard Bausch, Louis Begley, A.L. Kennedy, Ian McEwan and Michael Ondaatje have approached this tragic period from different perspectives, each seeking to make new the terrible history. Now Chris Bohjalian, author of the hugely popular The Double Bind and Midwives, has entered this arena at his own very particular angle.</p><p></p><p>Skeletons at the Feast, his 11th novel, depicts two journeys in the winter and spring of 1945. The larger part of the narrative follows the Emmerich family as they leave Prussia and flee westward before the advancing Russian army. Also on the move, painfully slowly, is a group of Jewish women, mostly French, who are being driven by their Nazi guards, perhaps toward death, perhaps toward another camp.</p><p>From this harrowing premise, Bohjalian spins a suspenseful tale that examines several not unfamiliar questions: How much did civilians know about what was going on in Germany? How are people changed by war and violence? Who is responsible for what? But these questions take on a new imperative in his hands. </p><p></p><p>At the heart of the novel is its romantic and moral heroine, 18-year-old golden-haired Anna Emmerich. Anna has grown up on an estate in East Prussia, her family home for generations, where until late 1944 the main impact of the war has been the loss of all able-bodied young men. Her father continues to farm using POWs, and Anna falls in love with one of the prisoners: Callum Finella. A 20-year-old Scottish paratrooper, Callum was captured in France before he fired a shot. But now, as the Russians approach amid rumors of violence and torture, the family reluctantly decides to leave the farm and to take Callum with them, hoping that he will buy them safe conduct from the Allied armies. </p><p></p><p>Bohjalian is very good at scenes of mass chaos, and he paints a vivid picture of the Emmerichs and their two wagons crossing the frozen Vistula River. Only when they are on the far side does the father announce that he and Anna's twin brother are returning to join a last-ditch attempt to halt the Russians. Anna, her mother, her little brother and Callum are left to continue their march westward. </p><p></p><p>The account of the Emmerichs' journey is geographically precise; the journey of the French prisoners is harder to map because these women have no idea where they are. Bohjalian focuses mainly on a prisoner named Cecile. Like Anna, Cecile comes from a privileged background and, like Anna, she proves surprisingly resilient. Three things sustain her during the unbelievable hardships of the work camp where she is held at the beginning of the novel: her optimism, her friendship with another inmate and her fianc�'s hiking boots. As the fighting moves closer, the routine horrors of the camp undergo a change: "Almost without exception, those survivors who could still stand found themselves less likely to avert their eyes when they saw the guards. It wasn't that they had suddenly grown bold; it was that watching the transformation of each of the guards was irresistible. . . . Most of the guards seemed less likely to fire a shot into the back of anyone's skull. . . . Three days passed without a single woman being hanged by the camp gate because her sewing at the clothing works had been deemed sub par." The women dare to imagine that salvation may be at hand, but soon Cecile and the other prisoners are marched from the camp, in bitter winter weather, to an unknown destination.</p><p></p><p>The third element of Bohjalian's plot is Uri. Or should we call him Henrik? Or Manfred? Since he escaped from a transport train on the way to Auschwitz, Uri has survived by borrowing the uniforms and names of various German soldiers. He has become an avenging angel, killing Germans, especially those who claim to have murdered Jews, and sabotaging trains. Wherever he goes, Uri asks about his lost sister. He ends up joining the Emmerichs on their journey and, while still keeping secret his identity, begins to find solace in this other family.</p><p>These three narratives, and the several points of view he employs, allow Bohjalian to write a novel in which the plot triumphs over any single sorrow. There are many moments of loss and violence -- some heartbreaking -- but the reader quickly moves on. This swift pace and the resulting eschewal of sentimentality are part of the pleasure of Skeletons at the Feast, but I wish we could have paused a little longer at one or two of these moments. My other quibble -- and I blame my Scottish childhood for this -- is that occasionally Callum's speech does not ring entirely true. He seems, for a Scotsman of that period, a little too ready to talk about emotions. </p><p></p><p>But Bohjalian's sense of character and place, his skillful plotting and his clear grasp of this confusing period of history make for a deeply satisfying novel, one that asks readers to consider, and reconsider, how they would rise to the challenge of terrible deprivation and agonizing moral choices. </p><p> </p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

Painting's postconceptual resurgence at the start of the 1980s began a dramatic expansion of its field. If painting remains important today, it is because its contradictions have been acknowledged as artists have radically diversified the components of its production and presentation. This first anthology to focus on painting's multiple discourses over the last three decades brings together key statements, dialogues, and debates that have moved the conversation beyond the modern/postmodern dialectic while redefining the conditions necessary for an artwork to be described as &#x201c;painting.&#x201d; The diversity of contemporary painting's meanings and practices encompasses the randomness and eclecticism associated with Web-based creation. Although for many the presence of paint endures, others have argued for painting to be classed not as a material but as a philosophical category. Compiled by a leading critic of painting who actively participated in these conversations while also teaching young artists in the studio classroom, this collection ranges widely, to reflect the diversity of ways in which painting continues to be investigated and evaluated in studios, exhibition spaces, and the marketplace of ideas. These writings, statements, and interviews reflect ongoing debates and reignite questions for an as yet unimagined future of painting.</p></p><p>Terry R.

But this debate has been far too evocative for the art would simply to let it go, as Terry R. Myers points out in his introduction to this superb collection of iconic essays by artists and writers. His curated volume is full of revelations, demonstrating that it is the tension between the desire for painting and the theoretical arguments it provokes that continues to keep us intellectually and visually enthralled.

A selection of sketch art teaches students how to create problem-solving diagrams. This new edition of the text was designed to aggressively address the issue of problem solving for students (guided by contemporary physics education research). To this end Hecht has provided not only his approach to the five-step problem-solving framework but also a wide range of new problems and solutions specifically designed to build student capability and confidence.</p><p>Ph.D. Adelphi University"I really enjoy the writing style of the author, and I think the students would appreciate it as well. It makes the physics seem much less formidable to have the discussion in a somewhat more colloquial tone (with a little infusion of humor) than is often done in physics texts. The human element of physics is also clearly present in this text, which is also a plus for the students."<br><br>"The problems and examples are excellent. This was the first thing I turned to and immediately became engaged in this book! Hecht has the ability to create truly innovative examples where other authors are jaded and copy from each other."<br><br>"The writing style is student-friendly and thought provoking. Students reading this text would certainly not be bored! The author's use of pictures, illustrations, historical notes, references, and sidelines is quite effective. Clearly intensive research was done for each section to make it as interesting and creative as possible. The text has such an interesting presentation to it. I appreciate the creativity employed. I want to especially thank the author for paying attention to historical context. I think the author did a FANTASTIC job of incorporating sketches, photographs, illustrations, and diagrams in the book. The diverse approach to artistic representation is very much appreciated by both student and instructor. The "side notes" that accompany each figure, sketch, drawing, and illustration is complete and to the point. Those explanations are concise and topic-relevant. The quality and quantity of figures in Hecht's book should be the envy of other College Physics texts."</p><h2>General Chemistry Laboratory Notebook</h2><p>This 100-page lab notebook is essential in today&#39;s lab.</p><p></p><h2>Student Workbook for Physics for Scientists and Engineers: A Strategic Approach</h2><p><b>A research-driven approach, fine-tuned for even greater ease-of-use and student success</b> <p></p> For the <b>Fourth Edition </b>of<b> <i>Physics for Scientists and Engineers</i>, </b> Knight continues to build on strong research-based foundations with fine-tuned and streamlined content, hallmark features, and an even more robust MasteringPhysics program, taking student learning to a new level.

Interested in writing from an early age, Dumas left for Paris where he found work in the household of the Duc D&#39;Orleans. He soon found success writing historical plays and gained important friendships, money and the Librarianship of the Palais Royale. By 1832 his plays were celebrated throughout France, but he contracted cholera and was sent to Switzerland to convalesce. There he took to writing travel books and eventually turned to fiction, primarily adventure stories and historical novels, for which he has an enduring reputation.

It establishes foundational concepts for understanding how space, time, place and nature - the material frames of daily life - are constituted and represented through social practices, not as separate elements but in relation to each other. It describes how geographical differences are produced, and shows how they then become fundamental to the exploration of political, economic and ecological alternatives to contemporary life. <p>The book is divided into four parts. Part I describes the problematic nature of action and analysis at different scales of time and space, and introduces the reader to the modes of dialectical thinking and discourse which are used throughout the remainder of the work. Part II examines how "nature" and "environment" have been understood and valued in relation to processes of social change and seeks, from this basis, to make sense of contemporary environmental issues.</p> <p>Part III, is a wide-ranging discussion of history, geography and culture, explores the meaning of the social "production" of space and time, and clarifies problems related to "otherness" and "difference". The final part of the book deploys the foundational arguments the author has established to consider contemporary problems of social justice that have resulted from recent changes in geographical divisions of labor, in the environment, and in the pace and quality of urbanization.</p> <p><i>Justice, Nature and the Geography of Difference</i> speaks to a wide readership of students of social, cultural and spatial theory and of the dynamics of contemporary life. It is a convincing demonstration that it is both possible and necessary to value difference and to seek a just social order.</p></p><p><b>David Harvey</b> is Professor of Geography at the Johns Hopkins University.

For the most part, the material is arranged geographically and chronologically. In addition to Burroughs's life and art, the topics covered reflect the concerns of his novels narcotics addiction and drug laws, control and deconditioning, homosexuality, overpopulation, and censorship. Of particular note after September 11 are Burroughs's comments on terrorism. Burroughs, as Lotringer notes, hated being interviewed, and that's evident, particularly in the flat responses made in some of the shorter pieces. There is a good deal of repetition, and the editor's decision to provide bibliographic citations at the end of the volume rather than in a headnote is a real inconvenience to the reader, who must flip back and forth to find the source of each interview. Those industrious enough to sift through the silt will no doubt find their share of gold nuggets, but most readers will be adequately served by the more selective Conversations with William S.

From this starting point, Anne Carson launches an exploration, poetic in its own right, of the idea of poetic economy. She offers a reading of certain of Simonides' texts and aligns these with writings of the modern Romanian poet Paul Celan, a Jew and survivor of the Holocaust, whose "economies" of language are notorious. Asking such questions as, What is lost when words are wasted? and Who profits when words are saved? Carson reveals the two poets' striking commonalities.</p><br><p> In Carson's view Simonides and Celan share a similar mentality or disposition toward the world, language and the work of the poet. <i>Economy of the Unlost</i> begins by showing how each of the two poets stands in a state of alienation between two worlds. In Simonides' case, the gift economy of fifth-century b.c. Greece was giving way to one based on money and commodities, while Celan's life spanned pre- and post-Holocaust worlds, and he himself, writing in German, became estranged from his native language. Carson goes on to consider various aspects of the two poets' techniques for coming to grips with the invisible through the visible world. A focus on the genre of the epitaph grants insights into the kinds of exchange the poets envision between the living and the dead. Assessing the impact on Simonidean composition of the material fact of inscription on stone, Carson suggests that a need for brevity influenced the exactitude and clarity of Simonides' style, and proposes a comparison with Celan's interest in the "negative design" of printmaking: both poets, though in different ways, employ a kind of negative image making, cutting away all that is superfluous. This book's juxtaposition of the two poets illuminates their differences--Simonides' fundamental faith in the power of the word, Celan's ultimate despair--as well as their similarities; it provides fertile ground for the virtuosic interplay of Carson's scholarship and her poetic sensibility.</p></p><p><p>"This is a remarkable, gripping, and moving book, itself a kind of extended prose poem, crafted by Carson between the excerpts of the two poets and her amazing readings and juxtapositions thereof. Like all of Carson's writing, it is sui generis, combining meticulous scholarship with the sensibility and style of a poet. I have always felt it was a privilege simply to be allowed to read Carson's work, and this manuscript is perhaps the best thing she has done."--<b>Leslie Kurke, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><b>Anne Carson</b> is a poet, essayist and scholar of classics who lives in Montreal.

Original.</p><p>Janet and Greta Podleski, also known as The Looneyspoons Sisters, are the high-energy authors of the low-fat cookbook <i>Looneyspoons</i> and its follow-up, <i>Crazy Plates</i>. But to call these sisters cookbook authors may be a misnomer: they're more like a wacky comedy team touring Hoboken doing the low-fat-zealot routine for admiring audiences. <p> No, <i>Crazy Plates</i> is not just about low-fat recipes. There's much, much more here, including fat facts (a pound of body fat--representative of 3,500 calories--if shaped into a ball, would be the size of a softball and equal four sticks of butter), "Trivial Tidbits" (baking soda used to be added to the water for boiling vegetables until it was discovered that it destroyed the veggies' vitamin C), "You Do the Math" (substituting Canadian bacon for the regular high-fat stuff once a week for a year will cut your fat intake by 1,196 grams), and <i>a lot</i> of corny humor ("Did you hear what happened to the peanut when he walked through the park? He was a salted"). Then there are the recipes--accompanied, of course, by cartoons--like Salmon Davis Jr., broiled salmon steaks in a spicy tomato sauce; Mercedes Buns, cinnamon rolls with less than three grams of fat per serving; My Yammi Spice, oven-baked fries with cumin, paprika, and oregano; and Berry Maniloaf, a lemon and raspberry bread loaf with 161 calories per slice. </p><p> The recipes are well laid out, not time-consuming, aimed at the home cook with a family to feed, and will please the palate of those wanting gourmet fare without the fat. But how do the Podleski sisters accomplish this rare feat? Spices are an essential ingredient of many dishes: Name That Tuna Salad, for example, gets its character from basil, mint, garlic, and Dijon mustard--with no help from that scary sidekick, mayo! This is a book for anyone who wants to cut back on fat without losing flavor, and for those that like a little slapstick with their flapjacks (Peter Pancakes, with bananas and strawberry sauce). <i>--Stefanie Durbin</i></p>Janet and Greta Podleski have been profiled in <i>People</i>, interviewed on the "Today Show," and sold themselves into bestselling heaven on QVC. Their success story is the stuff of legend. The Podleski sisters put everything into their first cookbook--literally. They quit their jobs, sold their car, and Janet even parted with her wedding dress at a yard sale (she did keep her husband). Still short on funds and needing expert advice, they approached Dave Chilton (author of the 2-million-copy bestseller <i>The Wealthy Barber</i> and popular PBS-TV personality). He was so taken by the sisters' infectious enthusiasm--and Greta's lowfat cheesecake--that he offered to invest in the project.

Archibald John Motley, Jr., was an American painter, master colorist, and radical interpreter of urban culture. Among twentieth-century American artists, Motley is surely one of the most important and, paradoxically, also one of the most enigmatic. Born in New Orleans in 1891, Motley spent the first half of the twentieth century living and working in a predominately white neighborhood on Chicago's South Side, just blocks away from the city's burgeoning black community. During his formative years, Chicago's African American population increased dramatically, and he was both a witness to and a visual chronicler of that expansion. In 1929 he won a Guggenheim Fellowship, which funded a critical year of study in France, where he painted Blues and other memorable pictures of Paris. In the 1950s, Motley made several lengthy visits to Mexico, where his nephew, the well-known novelist Willard F. Motley, lived. While there, Motley created vivid depictions of Mexican life and landscapes. He died in Chicago in 1981.&nbsp;Motley's brilliant yet idiosyncratic paintings&#x2014;simultaneously expressionist and social realist&#x2014;have captured worldwide attention with their rainbow-hued, syncopated compositions. The exhibition includes the artist's depictions of African American life in early-twentieth-century Chicago, as well as his portraits and archetypes, portrayals of African American life in Jazz Age Paris, and renderings of 1950s Mexico. The catalogue includes an essay by Richard J. Powell, organizer and curator of Archibald Motley: Jazz Age Modernist, as well as contributions from other scholars examining the life, work, and legacy of one of twentieth-century America's most significant artists.&nbsp;After debuting at the Nasher Museum of Art, the exhibition will travel to other museums across the country: the Amon Carter Museum of American Art, Fort Worth, Texas; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, California; Chicago Cultural Center, Illinois; and Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.&nbsp;Contributors: Davarian L. Baldwin, David C. Driskell, Olivier Meslay, Amy M. Mooney, Richard J. Powell, Ishmael Reed&nbsp;Publication of the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University&nbsp;<br></p><p><p>Richard J. Powell is the John Spencer Bassett Professor of Art and Art History at Duke University. He teaches courses in American art, the arts of the African Diaspora, and contemporary visual studies, and writes extensively on topics ranging from primitivism to postmodernism.

This exhibition and the accompanying catalogue offer a chance to slow down and contemplate these captures of African-American culture, with the contradictions in Motley&#x2019;s work reflecting the complications of his own identity, as well as those of his subjects.&#x201d; (Allison Meier <i>Hyperallergic</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Richard Powell in his key essay in the catalogue suggests that Motley&#x2019;s omission from the narrative was partly geographic. Motley was rooted in Chicago, not New York. More substantively, however, in Powell&#x2019;s trenchant formulation, &#x2018;the transgressive vernacular&#x2019; of Motley&#x2019;s account of the African American experience and his astonishing rainbow palette delayed proper recognition of his quality and significance. It is clear from the Whitney retrospective that what makes Motley such an exhilarating presence in modern American art is that concentration on African American life.&#x201d; (Patrick McCaughey <i>TLS</i> 2015-12-02)</p><h2>Becoming a Therapist: What Do I Say, and Why?</h2><p>This book provides students and novice clinicians with nuts-and-bolts advice about the process of doing therapy, starting with the first contact with a new patient. Filling a typical gap in clinical training, the book focuses on such real-world tasks as setting up appointments and discussing payment, conducting effective assessments while setting patients at ease, and dealing with mundane and serious clinical concerns, including suicidality. Featured are a wealth of sample therapist-patient dialogues that bring each situation to life. Suzanne Bender and Edward Messner--a junior clinician and a seasoned practitioner and supervisor--provide a unique, combined perspective on how therapy is conducted, what works and what doesn't work in treatment, and how to take care of oneself as a clinician. Each chapter opens with a concise summary and concludes with a list of key terms. The book also includes a helpful glossary and suggestions for further reading. <br></p><p>Suzanne Bender, MD, is a Staff Psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), where she works with children and adolescents, and Clinical Instructor in Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.<br><br> Edward Messner, MD, until his death in 2006, was a Senior Psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Associate Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.I.

In this encyclopedia, Claude Lecouteux explores the origins, connections, and tales behind many gods, goddesses, magical beings, rituals, folk customs, and mythical places of Norse and Germanic tradition. <br> <br>More than a reference to the Aesir and the Vanir pantheons, this encyclopedia draws upon a wealth of well-known and rare sources, such as the <i>Poetic Edda</i>, the S<i>aga of Ynglingar</i> by Snorri Sturluson, and <i>The Deeds of the Danes</i> by Saxo Grammaticus. Beyond the famous and infamous Norse gods and goddesses, Lecouteux also provides information on lesser-known figures from ancient Germanic pagan tradition such as the Elf King, the Lorelei, the Perchten, land spirits, fairies, dwarves, trolls, goblins, bogeymen, giants, and many other beings who roam the wild, as well as lengthy articles on well-known figures and events such as Siegfried (Sigurd in Norse) and Ragnar�k. The author describes the worship of the elements and trees, details many magical rituals, and shares wild folktales from ancient Europe, such as the strange adventure of Peter Schlemihl and the tale of the Cursed Huntsman. He also dispels the false beliefs that have arisen from the Nazi hijacking of Germanic mythology and from its longtime suppression by Christianity. <br> <br>Complete with rare illustrations and information from obscure sources appearing for the first time in English, this detailed reference work represents an excellent resource for scholars and those seeking to reconnect to their pagan pasts and restore the old religion.</p><p>Claude Lecouteux is a former professor of medieval literature and civilization at the Sorbonne. He is the author of numerous books on medieval and pagan afterlife beliefs and magic, including <i>The Book of Grimoires</i>, <i>Dictionary of Ancient Magic Words and Spells</i>, and <i>The Tradition of Household Spirits</i>. He lives in Paris.<b>INTRODUCTION <br> <br>A CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE <br> </b> <br><b>THE SURVIVAL OF THE GODS </b> <br> <br>The ancient mythological figures that have survived Christianization are rare. After a transitional period during which paganism and Christian faith were commingled, they only survived on the level of language: in frozen expressions and metaphors. This is how &#x201c;Odin&#x201d; and &#x201c;Troll&#x201d; became synonyms for the devil. Some figures were transformed and incorporated into folk legends--the Troll became a dwarf in Scandinavia and the Shetland Islands, where it is called <i>drow</i>--but examination of charms and spells reveals their persistent survival. <br> <br>During the eighteenth century, Odin became the leader of the Wild Hunt, as we are informed by the scholar Johann Peter Schmitt in 1742: <br> <br>It is said in particular that this younger Odin was an archmagician and had no peer in the arts of making war. This is why some people have sought to see his name Woden as a derivative of &#x201c;to rage&#x201d; (<i>w�ten</i>). Further, no one is unaware of the senseless belief held by countless folk, especially some hunters, that the time around Christmas and on the eve of Carnival is when the one called Woor or Goor or the wild huntsman passes. They say the devil organizes a hunt with a troop of rapping spirits. If we get to the bottom of this superstition, we see that it emerged from the story of this younger Odin, and that the common man thinks that Odin/Wotan passes. This is why a company of ghosts is called the Furious Army, Eotan&#x2019;s/ Odin&#x2019;s Army, Gooden&#x2019;s Army, or the Army of Odin. <i> <br> </i> <br><b>FOLK MYTHOLOGY </b> <br> <br>In tandem with the scholarly mythology, passed down by the ancient mythographers, there is a network of constantly evolving representations and beliefs. An image of a distinctive world emerges from this in which elemental and supernatural beings are no longer residents of a remote pantheon but live in close proximity to humans--in the forests and mountains, beneath the stones, and so forth. We sometimes find the faded figures of high mythology here, but we also find many elements that are not present. The bulk of these creatures, which are labeled as fantasy creatures today, continue to live in tales and legends, a source that should never be overlooked. The work of the Grimm brothers, for example, provides a fine overview, with its proliferation of nixies and kobolds, ogres and giants, changelings and dwarves, not to mention the major figures like Dame Holle or Holda, Percht, the Faithful Eckhart, <br>or the Cursed Huntsman. <br> <br>German romantic poets and writers, in the footsteps of Herder and the Grimm brothers, took hold of themes, creatures, and folk beliefs that we can now also see in Fr�d�ric de la Motte-Fouqu�&#x2019;s <i>Undine</i>, Adalbert de Chamisso&#x2019;s <i>Peter Schlemihl</i>, by way of <i>The Alder King</i>, <i>Lorelei</i>, and <i>Tannh�user</i>. <br> <br><b> <br>Encyclopedia of Norse and Germanic Folklore, Mythology, and Magic <br><i> <br></i><i>From AAGE to ZWEIESAUGER</i> <br> <br>ABWASCHL:</b> The &#x201c;washer&#x201d; is a rapping spirit (poltergeist) of the Alpine meadows where the herds are taken in summer. He takes possession of these areas once the herds are taken back into the valleys for the winter, washing and scraping all the utensils left behind while making such a racket that all who pass by flee in terror. Sometimes he shows up to express his irritation when a cowherd goes dancing without his master&#x2019;s permission.<b> <br></b> <br><b>�GIR:</b> Sea giant whose name means &#x201c;merman.&#x201d; He possesses all the features of a sea god. His other names are Gymir and Hler; the latter name can be found in Hlesey, which means &#x201c;Isle of Hler&#x201d; where he resides. He is the son of Fornjotr and the sea goddess Ran is his daughter or wife. He has nine daughters who are identified with the waves. Their names are: Himinglaeva, Blodughalda, Hefring, Dufa, Udr, Hr�nn, Bylgja, Bara, and Kolga. <br> <br><b>AESIR:</b> One of the two major families of the Germanic pantheon, the other being the Vanir. <br> <br>The Aesir consist of Odin and his sons, Thor and Baldur, as well as the following deities: Nj�rdr, Freyr, Tyr, Heimdallr, Bragi, Vidar, Vali, Ullr, Hoenir, Forseti, and Loki. The Asyniur are Frigg, Freyja, Gefjon, Idunn, Gerdr, Sigyn, Fulla, Nanna, to which are sometimes added Eir, Lj�fn, Lofn, Var, V�r, Syn, Hlin, Snotra, and Gna. The Aesir live in Asgardr, and the more important among them have homes whose names are known to us. They are primarily of the martial function (the second function according to Dum�zil), but spill over into the first (royalty/priesthood) and the third (fertility/productiveness). <br> <br><b>ALBERICH 1 (&#x201c;Powerful Elf &#x201d;):</b> The elf or dwarf who is defeated by Siegfried in the <i>Nibelungenlied </i>(Song of the Nibelung). Alberich guards the treasure of Achilbung and Nibelung, mythical rulers whose names refer to mist and water--and he owns the cape of invisibility known as the Tarnkappe (called the <i>cape folette</i> in old French). In the Norse Deed of Sigurd, he corresponds to Andvari. He entered French letters under the name of Aub�ron and English letters as Oberon. <br> <br><b>ALBERICH 2 (Elberich):</b> In the legend of the Lombard king, Otnit, the dwarf Alberich is the father of heroes. He is invisible to everyone except to Ortnit, who wears a magic ring that Alberich gave to his mother. This guardian dwarf provides assistance to her son, Otnit, who is seeking to wed the daughter of the sultan Machorel who lives <br>at Muntabur (Mount Thabor). He gives the king a full suit of armor and the sword Rose. During the campaign against the infidels, Alberich plays all kinds of tricks on the pagans, breaking their idols and throwing their weapons into the castle moat. He makes fun of Machorel, who is unable to see him.</p><h2>Skylight</h2><p><b>A previously unpublished novel by&nbsp;a&nbsp;literary master, <i>Skylight</i> tells the intertwined stories of the residents of a faded apartment building in 1940s Lisbon. </b>&nbsp;Silvestre and Mariana, a happily married&nbsp;elderly couple, take in a young nomad, Abel, and soon discover their many differences. Adriana loves Beethoven more than any man, but her budding sexuality brings new feelings to the surface. Carmen left Galicia to marry humble Emilio, but hates Lisbon and longs for her first love, Manolo. Lidia used to work the streets, but now she&#x2019;s kept by Paulo, a wealthy man with a wandering eye. <p>These are just some of the characters in this early work, completed by Saramago in&nbsp;1953 but never published until now. With his characteristic compassion, depth, and wit, Saramago shows us the quiet contentment of a happy family and the infectious poison of an unhappy one. We see his characters&#x2019; most intimate moments as well as the casual encounters particular to neighbors living in close proximity. <i>Skylight</i> is a portrait of ordinary people, painted by a master of the quotidian, a great observer of the immense beauty and profound hardships of the modern world.</p></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, December 2014:</strong> Anyone who has ever lived in an apartment building is familiar with the unique intimacy that such dwellings unintentionally provide. You may never see your upstairs neighbor, but you know that he wakes up at 6am sharp, grinds his coffee beans, and has a parrot that knows how to say a few choice curse words. Sometimes you know far more--stories pieced together by casual encounters in common areas, or bits of conversations overheard through too-thin walls...In the previously unpublished novel, <i>Skylight</i>, the late, great Jos� Saramago gives us unfettered access to the lives of several tenants in a Lisbon apartment building in 1940&#x2014;lives that intersect and sometimes clash in shocking ways. Saramago&#x2019;s gift for penning well-drawn female characters is on full display here, as is his mastery of illuminating the extraordinary in the mundane. But <i>Skylight</i> is also a very philosophical novel in Saramago&#x2019;s signature style, one in which the characters wrestle with profound questions, questions the reader will grapple with long after the last page is turned. <i>&#x2013;Erin Kodicek</i></p>HMH hardcover 2014, previous ISBN 978-0-544-09002-6</p><h2>Alice Hartley&#39;s Happiness</h2><p><p>Alice Hartley can no longer arouse the interest of her pompous husband, the adulterous professor.

She was part of the generation of British artists that included Henry Moore (with whom she studied in Leeds) and Ben Nicholson (whom she married), and her sculpture explored the forms of life--especially human life--as well as those of mathematics. From the beginning, her work displayed a monumental power, and after World War II it received far wider recognition and acclaim. Hepworth later experimented in new substances such as sheet metal, wire, and bronze, but her work always maintained its nobility, subtlety, and flawless rendering of surface. She died in 1975, after a long illness that did not prevent her from completing the work many consider to be her masterpiece: The Family of Man. A. M. Hammacher, who knew Barbara Hepworth for many years, has provided a highly readable, thorough, and intimate portrait of this great twentieth-century artist.</p><p>Penelope Curtis is Director of Tate Britain.Text: English, Dutch (translation)</p><h2>Introduction to Partial Differential Equations: From Fourier Series to Boundary-Value Problems (Dover Books on Mathematics)</h2><p>This exceptionally well-written and well-organized text is the outgrowth of a course given every year for 45 years at the Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden.

Perceived by some as a threat, an indication of our loss of faith in our powers of musical creation, and by others as part of the evolution of modern attitudes towards performing styles, this trend towards "historically correct" interpretation has inspired lively debate among scholars and performers. Examining and questioning the prevailing basis for the so-called "authenticity" movement, this collection of papers deals with the conflict between approaching early music performance with respect for the composer's original intentions, and the shortcomings, according to many musicians, that this produces. The contributors include Gary Tomlinson, Will Crutchfield, Howard Mayer Brown, Robert Morgan, Philip Brett, and Richard Taruskin.<br></p><p>This book attempts for the first time to explore the thinking behind the search for so-called authenticity in musical performance, and to question some of the received opinions about its worth and purpose.Nicholas Kenyon is Editor of Early Music, music critic of The Observer, and a broadcaster.</p><h2>The Invisible Actor</h2><p>First Published in 1998.

Acclaimed historian Mark Mazower forces us to set aside the popular myth that the UN miraculously rose from the ashes of World War II as the guardian of a new and peaceful global order, offering instead a strikingly original interpretation of the UN's ideological roots, early history, and changing role in world affairs.</p><br><p> Mazower brings the founding of the UN brilliantly to life. He shows how the UN's creators envisioned a world organization that would protect the interests of empire, yet how this imperial vision was decisively reshaped by the postwar reaffirmation of national sovereignty and the unanticipated rise of India and other former colonial powers. This is a story told through the clash of personalities, such as South African statesman Jan Smuts, who saw in the UN a means to protect the old imperial and racial order; Raphael Lemkin and Joseph Schechtman, Jewish intellectuals at odds over how the UN should combat genocide and other atrocities; and Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, who helped transform the UN from an instrument of empire into a forum for ending it.</p><br><p> A much-needed historical reappraisal of the early development of this vital world institution, <i>No Enchanted Palace</i> reveals how the UN outgrew its origins and has exhibited an extraordinary flexibility that has enabled it to endure to the present day.</p></p><p><br><p>"This is a sprawling tale told with great energy, verve, and insight.

He fished the lakes and creeks near the family&#x2019;s summer home at Walloon Lake, Michigan, and his first stories and pieces of journalism were often about his favorite sport. Here, collected for the first time in one volume, are all of his great writings about the many kinds of fishing he did&#x2014;from angling for trout in the rivers of northern Michigan to fishing for marlin in the Gulf Stream. <br><br>In <i>A Moveable Feast, </i>Hemingway speaks of sitting in a caf� in Paris and writing about what he knew best&#x2014;and when it came time to stop, he &#x201c;did not want to leave the river.&#x201d; The story was the unforgettable classic &#x201c;Big Two-Hearted River,&#x201d; and from its first words we do not want to leave the river either. He also wrote articles for <i>The Toronto Star </i>on fishing in Canada and Europe and, later, articles for <i>Esquire </i>about his growing passion for big-game fishing. Two of his last books, <i>The Old Man and the Sea </i>and <i>Islands in the Stream, </i>celebrate his vast knowledge of the ocean and his affection for its great denizens. <br><br><i>Hemingway on Fishing </i>is an encompassing, diverse, and fascinating assemblage. From the early Nick Adams stories and the memorable chapters on fishing the Irati River in <i>The Sun Also Rises </i>to such late novels as <i>Islands in the Stream, </i>this collection traces the evolution of a great writer&#x2019;s passion, the range of his interests, and the sure use he made of fishing, transforming it into the stuff of great literature. <br><br>Anglers and lovers of great writing alike will welcome this important collection.</p><p>Ernest Hemingway did more to influence the style of English prose than any other writer of his time. Publication of&nbsp;<i>The Sun Also Rises</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>A Farewell to Arms</i>&nbsp;immediately established him as one of the greatest literary lights of the 20th century. His classic novella&nbsp;<i>The Old Man and the Sea&nbsp;</i>won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. He died in 1961.Ernest Hemingway Introduction<p></p> 1<p></p> <br>&#x201c;What did I know best that I had not written about and lost?&#x201d; Hemingway asks in A Moveable Feast, as he recalls sitting in a corner of the Closerie des Lilas on the rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs in 1924 and beginning to write &#x201c;Big Two-Hearted River.&#x201d; It was to be his longest story until then&#x2014;some one hundred pages of handwritten manuscript. And the subject? &#x201c;There was no choice at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>There is a wonderful photograph of Hemingway, already a fisherman, with a broad-brimmed straw hat and a huge cane pole; it was taken on Horton&#x2019;s Creek, near Charlevoix, Michigan, when he was five years old. The creel over his shoulder looks large enough to carry one hundred brook trout. He fished first with his father, Dr. Clarence Hemingway, a keen sportsman, and with friends like Howell Jenkins, Lewis Clarahan, John Pentecost, Bill Smith, Al Walker, and others, on rivers and in lakes in northern Michigan, near the family&#x2019;s summer home on Walloon Lake, near Petoskey. There are photographs of him with pike, bass, and perch, but he seems from early on to have preferred moving water and trout. And always, as Carlos Baker notes in Ernest Hemingway: A Life Story, he &#x201c;shared his father&#x2019;s determination to do things &#x2018;properly&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2014;a phrase and concept he carried with him into his love of hunting, his passion for bullfighting, his big-game fishing, and his fierce will to be a great writer.<br> <br>In June of 1916, he took a steamer from Chicago to Onekama, Michigan, and trekked with Lewis Clarahan for ten days to Petoskey, keeping a detailed diary. They fished Bear Creek, the Manistee, the Boardman, and the Rapid, and the diary is early evidence of the care he devoted first to planning the trip, to recording what he saw, and to his skill at camping and fishing. Closer to Walloon Lake he had long fished little creeks like Schultz&#x2019;s and Horton&#x2019;s, often by lowering bait into the tangles of deadfalls and hoisting fish abruptly out onto the shore, and later the Black, the Sturgeon, and the Pigeon in the Pine Barrens southeast of Petoskey, usually with worms or grasshoppers, though occasionally with a fly. The McGinty was the first fly he had confidence in, and he never progressed as a fly fisherman much beyond wet-fly fishing. His son Jack says, in Misadventures of a Fly Fisherman, that his father liked best to fish a &#x201c;two- or three-fly wet-fly rig through the riffles&#x201d;&#x2014;using a McGinty, a Coch-y-Bondhu, and a Woodcock Green and Yellow for the tail fly. Ninety percent of his fly fishing was done across and downstream with this team of flies, which sometimes included a Yellow Sally or a Royal Coachman. For a writer so beloved by fly fishermen, he shows little interest in this brand of fishing, makes a sharp comment about fly fishermen in &#x201c;Big Two-Hearted River,&#x201d; and there&#x2019;s little evidence throughout his life that he released fish except if they were too small or he&#x2019;d taken enough to eat; he claimed he hated to be photographed but there are thousands of photographs of him with gigantic dead fish.<br> <br>Perhaps Hemingway found the esoterica of fly fishing&#x2014;its fly-line sizes, Latin classifications of insects, and dozens of fly patterns and styles even then&#x2014;to be too much like jargon. There is little in his language, in any of his writing about fishing, that is not self-explanatory, that cannot be read with full understanding by the alert general reader. We feel, in all of Hemingway&#x2019;s writing about fishing, that he has special knowledge, true authority&#x2014;but we never feel he is writing in ways that exclude those without such special knowledge.<br> <br>When Hemingway had finished writing for the day at the Closerie des Lilas, he &#x201c;did not want to leave the river&#x201d; and could still &#x201c;see the trout in the pool, its surface pushing and swelling smooth against the resistance of the log-driven piles of the bridge.&#x201d; I have stood on that railroad bridge, just west of Seney, and though in the late 1990s I could not see one trout and the bottom had silted in, it is still a lovely piece of water and Hemingway caught it, and its tawny color, exactly right.<br> <br><br> <br>Hemingway&#x2019;s passion for fishing, the way it intertwines with his life as a writer and finally culminates in the novella The Old Man and the Sea, is the simple focus of this collection. The pilgrimage of his life is recorded in his stories and articles: from the solitary Nick to the public Papa, photographed with his big kills, from the stillness of trout fishing in northern Michigan, with its healing powers, to the unalloyed excitement and challenge of big-game fishing, where one is alone in other ways, locked in what approaches a life-and-death struggle. From the beginning, he loved sport, grew expert at the various aspects of the brand of fishing he chose to pursue, and always found a way to use it deftly in his writing. But beyond that, fishing, which kept him wedded to the natural world, was an important enough part of his life to affect all of his writing, and understanding its importance helps us understand a lot about the man and a lot about all of his writing, always his most stringent commitment.<br> <br>Early photographs and letters, his 1916 diary of the trip to Walloon Lake, and then his first reportage for the Toronto Star, show that he fished regularly and with skill and success. Fishing was a source of sheer fun and adventure, a respite from the increasing complexity of his life, and a place to test his skills and to heal. Even early short stories like &#x201c;Indian Camp&#x201d;&#x2014;still one of my favorites&#x2014;show how the details and language of fishing filtered naturally into his stories: the father sewing up the Indian woman, after performing a cesarian operation with a jackknife, with fishing gut, and the bass jumping at the end.<br> <br>In &#x201c;Big Two-Hearted River&#x201d; he finds a connection between writing and fishing that was both new and remarkable, and here we can actually see how he transformed experience into art.<br> <br>Hemingway had fished a river called the Fox, near the town of Seney on Michigan&#x2019;s Upper Peninsula, with his friends Al Walker and Jock Pentecost, in September 1919, after he had returned from Red Cross ambulance service in Italy during the First World War. He had been wounded by a mortar shell and machine-gun fire, and had been hospitalized in Milan with hundreds of pieces of shrapnel in his lower body. The trip he took with his friends, reported in a letter to Howell Jenkins, was scarcely the brooding, meditative, mysterious journey he describes in his story, but rather one filled with the excitement and high jinks of young men off in the woods, catching and boasting about having taken more than two hundred wild brook trout&#x2014;some up to 2-1/2 pounds&#x2014;camping out, shooting at deer with a .22. When he began to write &#x201c;Big Two-Hearted River&#x201d; in Paris, he started: &#x201c;We got off the train at Seney.&#x201d; &#x201c;Jock&#x201d; and &#x201c;Al&#x201d; are characters in that first, tentative beginning, and &#x201c;They all three&#x201d; stand and look at the burned-out town of Seney; Al says: &#x201c;This was the toughest town in Michigan.&#x201d; Then he changed the opening to &#x201c;They got off the train at Seney&#x201d;; and then, after three pages, he abandoned the story. Only when he begins, &#x201c;The train went on up the track out of sight&#x201d; and eliminates his two friends does the actual event begin to fade, in deference to the fictional event. He is already there; generalities like &#x201c;toughest&#x201d; are replaced by details like the &#x201c;thirteen saloons that had once lined the streets of Seney&#x201d;; details extraneous to the theme of the story (about the burned-out town, for example) are trimmed; and the country and his fishing and his inner life become the true center of the story.<br> <br>The sight of the trout, clearly after some period of time away from trout rivers, leads him to feel &#x201c;all the old feeling.&#x201d; He relishes the long and demanding trip upriver; and as he carefully and &#x201c;properly&#x201d; makes his camp, cooks his food, and the next day begins to fish, the underlying, unspoken tension is that he is, with deliberation, reconstructing a life. Each gesture&#x2014;from rigging his tackle, collecting grasshoppers, putting them on the hook to catching and putting a few fish into his canvas fish sack&#x2014;is performed with the same ritual care. We know nothing other than his actions about what might have precipitated this deliberateness. We know that he does not want to &#x201c;rush&#x201d; his sensations. We know he wants to master his feelings. Much later, in &#x201c;The Art of the Short Story,&#x201d; Hemingway said that he had made up the entire story, that &#x201c;there were many Indians in the story, just as the war was in the story, and none of the Indians nor the war appeared.&#x201d; The real trip has vanished.<br> <br>Such writing depends first upon a capacity to &#x201c;get the feeling of the actual life across,&#x201d; as he wrote to his father just before the story was to appear in The Transatlantic Review, &#x201c;not to just depict life&#x2014;or criticize it&#x2014;but to actually make it alive. So that when you have read something by me you actually experience the thing.&#x201d; This is of course what happens most distinctly in &#x201c;Big Two-Hearted River.&#x201d; We are very much there with the young man, participating in the fishing trip that is so much more than a fishing trip. The story has the feel of the river; it registers the young man&#x2019;s affection for the pursuit of trout; it represents by indirection a disciplined search for control by Nick, a control that he cannot yet extend to fishing in the swamp. Throughout, he uses images and events that ascend into metaphor. The sharks that devour Santiago&#x2019;s great marlin are real sharks and they suggest a hundred forces in a life that might attack and destroy one&#x2019;s accomplishments; the burned-out town of Seney suggests burned-out emotions; and the swamp, which I&#x2019;ve seen, is still a very real danger. He will save that for another day.<br> <br>The story is seminal to any understanding of Hemingway, both as a fisherman and as an artist. In it he finds a sure way to use the special, even expert, knowledge he has acquired about angling, which he will carry to Islands in the Stream and The Old Man and the Sea, and into his fiction about bullfighting and hunting. He learns, as he writes to Gertrude Stein, to &#x201c;do&#x201d; the country like C�zanne&#x2014;as if seeing it for the first time, inventing tree and shadow, without sentimentality or rhetoric or &#x201c;tricks&#x201d; that will &#x201c;go bad afterward,&#x201d; not mannered, not describing but reducing the imagery to an elemental world that we can enter and cannot leave, all of its forms pointing to one effect, direct, spare, elusive, as clear and mysterious as a spring creek, as clear today as it was in 1925&#x2014;and just as rare.<br> 2<p></p> <br>Hemingway found saltwater fishing in 1928 when John Dos Passos introduced him to Key West and he soon moved there with his second wife, Pauline Pfeiffer. They bought the house at 907 Whitehead Street that is now a Hemingway museum, in 1931.<br> <br>While in Europe, in the 1920s, he had fished for trout in the Black Forest and the Pyren�es and had written articles about the good places he had found; he shared his enthusiasm with his father&#x2014;fishing remained their firmest connection&#x2014;and he also shared his disappointment that the Irati, which he had fished with such pleasure in 1924, had been ruined by logging and the electric companies. But except for occasional trips to Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, his primary fishing thereafter was all in salt water.<br> <br>At first he fished mostly from the piers and bridges, catching that great grab bag of strong fish from the ocean that dwarfed in size the trout he&#x2019;d been used to taking&#x2014;grouper, jacks, snapper, and tarpon. Even later, after he had become fascinated by boats and bigger game, Kip Farrington reports: &#x201c;Ernest was as happy with the catching of a five-pound fish as with catching a 400-pounder, and many times he would go bottom fishing in the evenings and bone-fishing after a long day in the Gulf Stream&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He even ends one of his Cuban Letters for Esquire magazine with these words: &#x201c;I would like to go back to fishing for fun and take a day off and go snapper fishing over by the concrete ship.&#x201d;<br> <br>But boats gave him a much broader world, a much larger playing field with discrete challenges, a place to test brawn and courage and endurance. He fished in the Marquesas and the Dry Tortugas, and now he grew to love to troll, especially rigged baits, for king-fish, wahoo, barracuda, and eventually sailfish, tuna, and marlin. He had a will to master, to win, and since he was a natural competitor&#x2014;a boxer, hunter, lover of fighting cocks, and competition of all sorts&#x2014;and since he loved both the physical risk and the life-and-death struggle, it was natural that he gravitated more toward big-game fishing and found in it an ultimate challenge. A fight with a truly big fish was a test of self. &#x201c;Il faut (d&#x2019;abord) durer&#x201d; he liked to say, about life and a fight with some mammoth fish&#x2014;one must, above all, endure.<br> <br>After he bought the Pilar in 1935, in his fascination with the Gulf Stream and its great denizens, Hemingway studied sharks and marlin with the care and zeal of a naturalist. Beginning in 1928, he often fished with Carlos Gutierrez, a commercial fisherman from Cojimar, the small picturesque town ten miles east of Havana&#x2014;and the home of Santiago, his central figure in The Old Man and the Sea. And he invited Charles M. B. Cadwalader, Director of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, and Henry Fowler, Chief Ichthyologist at the Academy, to study marlin with him. Together they caught, measured, and dissected fish, and Hemingway kept extensive day-log journals, amounting to many hundreds of pages, about what they learned. He also fished with Dr. Perry W. Gilbert, a shark expert and head of the Mote Laboratory in Sarasota, Florida. In the journals, he records the people on board, barometer readings, the amount of gas put in, the cost of the gas, the number of commercially caught marlin in the market (and their sizes), the time out, and the weather; there are detailed notations on what fish they caught, how, at what time, their sizes, time of capture, weather conditions, information about what sharks they saw, seeds for later writing, and what they had for dinner. He took careful notes on sharks and cataloged the principal kinds found in Cuban waters, their size range, and whether or not they were man-eaters, and if they would respond to shark repellents.<br> <br>He had lost most of his first tuna and marlin to sharks off Bimini and devised two methods of dealing with them. He told Kip Farrington that it was necessary to bring fish in quickly, before sharks could locate them, and that for this you must &#x201c;convince&#x201d; all big fish, and to do this you must be willing to suffer. And he began to carry a Thompson submachine gun on board the Pilar, which he used with glee to kill sharks. Aggressive fishing became his hallmark.<br> <br>Within six years of the time he began to fish for big game in the Gulf Stream, out of Key West, then Bimini, then Havana, he was viewed by many of the best big-game fishermen in the world&#x2014;Farrington, Michael Lerner, Van Campen Heilner&#x2014;as their peer and as a great innovator. He was asked to write the marlin section for Eugene V. Connett&#x2019;s American Big Game Fishing and the chapter on Cuban fishing for Game Fish of the World, as well as more fugitive but highly authoritative articles for Esquire and Look. He took a keen interest in the technology and ethics of big-game sport fishing and served on the governing board of the International Game Fish Association, founded by Michael Lerner in 1940.

James Mead grew up in Davenport, Iowa, but during his youth he dreamed about going to the Kansas Territory, which he did in his early twenties. This volume is compiled from his journal and letters. It is an interesting account of how Kansas was populated, the type of settlements and the type of people who were attracted to the Kansas during this period. It is replete with lots of information on hunting and trapping and includes many encounters with the American Indian population in the state. It is hard to imagine the great amount of game that was available during this early period of Kansas History. It seems that turkey, squab, quail and other game birds were in great abundance, basically for the taking. Buffalo, elk, and other large mammals were common. Mr. Mead knew Jesse Chisholm, William &#34;Buffalo Bill&#34; Matthewson and Kit Carson, as well as famous Indians such as Santana, War Chief of the Kiowas. This book provides an excellent picture of life in early Kansas, and would make good reading for all ages from Junior High upward.</p><p></p><h2>Selected Writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson (Signet Classics)</h2><p>A classic collection of critical essays, poems, and letters from one of the greatest minds of nineteenth-century America.</p><p>"Standing on the bare ground--my head bathed by the blithe air and uplifted into infinite space--all mean egotism vanishes," Emerson wrote in <b>Nature</b>, his statement of the principles of transcendentalism.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I become a transparent eyeball."&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Nature</b>, published in 1836 when Emerson was thirty-three, is collected here with his book of observations on the English people; a famous sermon against administering communion in church; a sketch of his step-grandfather; the eulogy he delivered at the funeral of his Concord friend and neighbor Henry David Thoreau; twenty-three poems; and addresses, lectures, and essays on such subjects as slavery, self-reliance, and organized Christianity's obsession with the person of Jesus.&nbsp;&nbsp;Emerson called transcendentalism another word for idealism--"a hypothesis to account for nature by other principles than those of carpentry and chemistry."&nbsp;&nbsp;Considered intensely radical at a time when materialism and a rigid form of Christianity were ascendant, he urged Americans to "enjoy an original relation to the universe."&nbsp;&nbsp;These selections span Emerson's career as author and traveling lecturer, and chart his evolving thought:&nbsp;&nbsp;the concepts of the "oversoul", individualism without egotism, and antimaterialism; a belief in intuition, independence, and "the splendid labyrinth of one's own perceptions."&#34;I was simmering, simmering, simmering. Emerson brought me to a boil.&#34; --Walt Whitman</p><h2>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</h2><p>Book about a woman growing up in Brooklyn at the turn of the century.</p><p>Francie Nolan, avid reader, penny-candy connoisseur, and adroit observer of human nature, has much to ponder in colorful, turn-of-the-century Brooklyn. She grows up with a sweet, tragic father, a severely realistic mother, and an aunt who gives her love too freely--to men, and to a brother who will always be the favored child. Francie learns early the meaning of hunger and the value of a penny. She is her father's child--romantic and hungry for beauty. But she is her mother's child, too--deeply practical and in constant need of truth. Like the Tree of Heaven that grows out of cement or through cellar gratings, resourceful Francie struggles against all odds to survive and thrive. Betty Smith's poignant, honest novel created a big stir when it was first published over 50 years ago. Her frank writing about life's squalor was alarming to some of the more genteel society, but the book's humor and pathos ensured its place in the realm of classics--and in the hearts of readers, young and old.

Each year thousands of educators are faced with having to set up new classrooms -- in general education, resource rooms, or self-contained settings. And each year these teachers create from scratch a plan to accomplish this task. What a waste of valuable time! Drs. Kabot and Reeve have now created the book that every educator needs. Using evidence-based practices and what we know about students with ASD and other special needs, the authors explain, and show, how to set up classroom spaces. The book contains dozens of pictures of actual classrooms for individuals with ASD across ages, presentation of ASD (classic to high-functioning/Asperger Syndrome), and settings. Every educational professional should own this book. --Brenda Smith Myles, PhD, international speaker and writer on autism spectrum disorders<br><br>Setting up the classroom environment for student success is something that many teachers know in theory, but struggle to put into practice. In SETTING UP CLASSROOM SPACES THE SUPPORT STUDENTS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS, Susan Kabot and Christine Reeve have not only answered questions related to why environmental supports are needed, they have also provided a step-by-step guide describing how to accomplish this task. This book is a 'must-have' for anyone setting up an environment for students with autism spectrum disorders. --Elisa Gagnon, ASD consultant, Blue Valley Schools, Overland Park, Kansas; author of POWER CARDS<br><br>As a special educator with 34 years in the field, this is the best and most practical guide for teachers and administrators I have ever read.

Whether it is through the study of the affect and ethics of ritual animal sacrifice, analysis of the right-wing political project of cow-protection, or examination of villagers&#x2019; talk about bears who abduct women and have sex with them, Govindrajan illustrates that multispecies relatedness relies on both difference and ineffable affinity between animals. <i>Animal Intimacies</i> breaks substantial new ground in animal studies, and Govindrajan&#x2019;s detailed portrait of the social, political and religious life of the region will be of interest to cultural anthropologists and scholars of South Asia as well. </p></p><p><b>Radhika Govindrajan</b> is assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Washington.&#x201c;Recommended. . .<i>Animal Intimacies</i>&nbsp;provides a fascinating ethnographic study on the social and emotional entanglements of humans and animals in the Kumaon region of the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand. . .Govindrajan&#x2019;s ethnography reveals that the agency of animal subjects has significantly shaped the social relations, everyday ethical practices, and religious worldviews of the Pahari peoples of Uttarakhand. This text will appeal widely to students interested in human-animal relations and critical applications of posthumanist theories.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Animal Intimacies</i> vividly conveys the intense entanglement of interspecies relations in Kumaon, a Himalayan region in the state of Uttarakhand in northern India. . . . The result is a highly readable and vital contribution to the discipline that illuminates the key theoretical debates in multispecies ethnography.&#x201d; (<i>American Ethnologist</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The antagonist hovering over Radhika Govindrajan's <i>Animal Intimacies</i> is not anthropocentrists, but rather those who kill and police humans in the animal's name. This attention to the political landscape, where violence articulates itself as from a place of love, is what makes her book so timely and important. Her close attention to the social, historical, and physical landscape of her fieldsite, Kumaon, which is part of India's state of Uttarakhand in the central Himalayas, and her ability to narrate the liveliness of these landscapes is what makes this book beautiful.&#x201d; (<i>Asian Ethnology</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A compelling book. In bringing to light the relatedness of human and non-human lives, Govindrajan illustrates the richness of such interactions. . . .&nbsp;The richness of the book means that it will be of interest to readers in the field of human-animal studies. It should also appeal to readers more generally as an example of how lived experiences reflect wider social, political and historical patterns.&#x201d; (<i>Contemporary South Asia</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Animal Intimacies</i> is written in a beautiful style, and the scholarship is exemplary: both rigorous and creative. Govindrajan's exceptional ethnography demonstrates the range of relationships people in the central Himalayas of India have with animals&#x2014;relationships that can be described, ultimately, as ones of everyday, entangled intimacy. By showing us the textures of these intimacies, Govindrajan demonstrates that animals are not mere objects in the lives and reflections of humans, but are thinking, feeling subjects themselves, playing equal parts in human-animal cohabitation.&#x201d; (<i>Naisargi N. Dave, University of Toronto</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Written in a lively style combining reflexive reportage with anthropological analysis,&nbsp;<i>Animal Intimacies</i>&nbsp;vividly portrays the everyday life and social concerns of villagers in the hill state of Uttarakhand through their interactions with household domesticates and encounters with forest animals. Its chapter-by-chapter engagement with a succession of distinct interspecies relations makes for a memorable and innovative ethnography. Govindrajan's richly detailed account of human lives led with animals succeeds in addressing many contemporary issues confronting people in India&#x2019;s hill-states, while also making a valuable contribution to the anthropology of human-animal relations.&#x201d; (<i>Piers Locke, University of Canterbury</i>)</p><h2>Evidence for Hope: Making Human Rights Work in the 21st Century (Human Rights and Crimes against Humanity, 28)</h2><p><p><b>A history of the successes of the human rights movement and a case for why human rights work</b></p><p><i>Evidence for Hope</i> makes the case that, yes, human rights work. Critics may counter that the movement is in serious jeopardy or even a questionable byproduct of Western imperialism. They point out that Guant�namo is still open, the Arab Spring protests have been crushed, and governments are cracking down on NGOs everywhere. But respected human rights expert Kathryn Sikkink draws on decades of research and fieldwork to provide a rigorous rebuttal to pessimistic doubts about human rights laws and institutions. She demonstrates that change comes slowly and as the result of struggle, but in the long term, human rights movements have been vastly effective.</p><p>Attacks on the human rights movement&#x2019;s credibility are based on the faulty premise that human rights ideas emerged in North America and Europe and were imposed on developing southern nations. Starting in the 1940s, Latin American leaders and activists were actually early advocates for the international protection of human rights. Sikkink shows that activists and scholars disagree about the efficacy of human rights because they use different yardsticks to measure progress. Comparing the present to the past, she shows that genocide and violence against civilians have declined over time, while access to healthcare and education has increased dramatically. Cognitive and news biases contribute to pervasive cynicism, but Sikkink&#x2019;s investigation into past and current trends indicates that human rights is not in its twilight. Instead, this is a period of vibrant activism that has made impressive improvements in human well-being.</p><p>Exploring the strategies that have led to real humanitarian gains since the middle of the twentieth century, <i>Evidence for Hope</i> looks at how these essential advances can be supported and sustained for decades to come.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Evidence for Hope</i> dismantles claims on both the left and right that human rights efforts have been a failure. On the contrary, social science evidence demonstrates areas of marked improvement, as well as notable setbacks. Kathryn Sikkink convincingly argues that activists should be resilient, drawing hope from institutionalized human rights ideals and from their frequent realization."<b>--Robert O. Keohane, Princeton University and author of <i>After Hegemony </i></b></p><p>"A fascinating and vitally important book for anyone interested in freedom around the world and how we can expand it. Kathryn Sikkink's portrait of human rights today is optimistic in the best sense--motivated not by a temperament that sees the glass as half full, but by a judicious look at the facts and a keen analytic eye."<b>--Steven Pinker, author of <i>The Better Angels of Our Nature</i></b></p><p>"With this book, Kathryn Sikkink shines a light on hope in times of disarray. She exposes how activists and politicians used human rights principles and institutions to end colonialism in Africa and Asia, and state terrorism in Latin America. <i>Evidence for Hope</i> demonstrates that human rights matter today more than ever."<b>--Luis Moreno Ocampo, former chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court</b></p><p>"Here is a powerful antidote for despair about the future of human rights. Kathryn Sikkink shows us that past progress was possible in the face of fierce headwinds and recalls that the movement's global roots have provided the strength to weather national and regional reversals. Her book arrives in the nick of time to remind us that great success can be achieved when citizens across the world work for a common cause."<b>--Stephen J. Rapp, former US Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice</b></p><p>"This important book argues that human rights has worked, does work, and can continue to do so. Connecting the past to the future, this is a history that is unashamed to teach us vital lessons."<b>--Jeremy Adelman, coauthor of <i>Worlds Together, Worlds Apart</i></b></p><p>"Kathryn Sikkink is one of the country's most distinguished scholars of human rights and a major figure in the study of international relations. In <i>Evidence for Hope</i>, she makes a powerful argument that rights ideals have made impressive progress around the world in the face of strong opposition. With its insights, erudition, and gusto, this wonderful book showcases her remarkable abilities and offers important lessons for wiser human rights policy."<b>--Gary Bass, author of <i>The Blood Telegram</i></b></p><b>Kathryn Sikkink</b> is the Ryan Family Professor of Human Rights Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, and the Carol K.

Reprint.</p><p>Fitzgerald&#39;s first novel, reprinted in the handsome Everyman&#39;s Library series of literary classic, uses numerous formal experiments to tell the story of Amory Blaine, as he grows up during the crazy years following the First World War. It also contains a new introduction by Craig Raine that describes critical and popular reception of the book when it came out in 1920.F. Scott Fitzgerald&#39;s This Side of Paradise is the opening statement of his literary career. Published originally in 1920, the novel captures the rhythm and feel of the gaudy decade that was to follow in America. This Side of Paradise made Fitzgerald simultaneously famous and infamous: famous for the stylish exuberance of his writing and infamous for the errors--in spelling, fact, grammar, and chronology--that peppered his text.

Soon, he had become an expert in racist ideology, a neo-Nazi terror who roamed the neighborhood, quick to throw fists. By the time he left the movement years later and was able to see clearly for the first time, Picciolini found that his life was in shambles and the nation around him was coming apart. <br><br> Told with startling intimacy and compassion, BREAKING HATE is the inside story of how extremists have taken the reins of our political discourse and a guide to how everyday Americans can win it back. The forces pushing to polarize and radicalize us are many--from fake news to coded language to Russian trolls to a White House that often aims to inflame rather than to heal. Increasingly, the information with which we construct our world views is segregated by social media stars and advertisers with murky motives to validate our worst impulses. As Picciolini demonstrates, our modern world systematically normalizes extremism in such a way that we grow blind to it, only recognizing it in the wake of tragedy. <br><br> Drawing on profiles of extremists that he works to free from violent ideology and on his own painful history leading and then escaping from an infamous neo-Nazi group, BREAKING HATE explains why terrorism and violence have come to characterize our daily lives and why that doesn't need to be the case. <br></p><p><b>Christian Picciolini </b>was born in the Blue Island neighborhood of Chicago, where he was radicalized at the age of fourteen and went on to become the leader of the notorious Chicago Hammerskins, one of the most violent hate groups in America, and the singer of two white power propaganda punk bands. After leaving the hate movement when he was nineteen years old, Picciolini began the painstaking process of rebuilding his life. He went on to earn a degree in International Business and International Relations from DePaul University and launch an entertainment and media firm. In 2010, he co-founded Life After Hate, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping communities and organizations gain the knowledge necessary to implement long-term solutions that counter all types of racism and violent extremism.</p><h2>Designing with Models: A Studio Guide to Architectural Process Models</h2><p><p>The newly updated guide to design process modeling techniques</p> <p>Designing with Models, Third Edition is the revised, step-by-step guide to basic and advanced design process modeling.

In these four plays, Shakespeare engages the problem that is central to tragedy and crucial to any human community&#x2014;the problem of violence and revenge&#x2014;on an unprecedented scale. No other literary texts have been more instrumental in deepening our knowledge of ourselves as individuals and as a civilization.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This authoritative edition of the plays is supplemented with footnotes, bibliographies, a detailed chronology of Shakespeare&#x2019;s life and times, and a substantial introduction in which Tony Tanner discusses each play individually while setting each in context.<br><br></p></p><p>An appealing collection of the great tragedies of Shakespeare, these plays express the full force of his dramatic and psychological insight, exploring the fatal flaws that lead to the fall of the mighty from good fortune. The hesitant vengefulness of Hamlet; the vain selfishness of Lear; the irrational jealousy of Othello; the cunning destructiveness of Iago; the romantic impulsiveness of Romeo; the murderous ambition of Lady Macbeth--all of these characters are burned into the collective psyche of world culture.Just why the history of Rome was so important to the Elizabethans, and how and to what ends Shakespeare imaginatively deployed that history, will be made a little clearer in the course of this introduction.</p><h2>Germany in the High Middle Ages: c.1050-1200 (Cambridge Medieval Textbooks)</h2><p>Germany in the High Middle Ages opens with a wide-ranging and yet detailed description of the conditions under which men lived and their attitudes of mind during the period 1050-1200: against this background it proceeds to analyse the fundamental political, social, economic and cultural changes of the period in central Europe. Professor Fuhrmann considers the social transformation brought about by the emergence of new classes such as ministeriales and burghers, and examines the intellectual renewal reflected in the rise of scholasticism and the foundation of the universities. He also describes the gradual erosion of the power of the German rulers, which led to the Empire losing its position as the leading power in Europe, and yet was accompanied, by a last flowering under the Staufen emperors amid the chivalric culture with which they were closely associated. Throughout the book these changes are contrasted with contemporary developments elsewhere in Europe, especially in France, England and Italy.</p><p>A comprehensive analysis of the fundamental political, social, economic and cultural changes in Europe between 1050 and 1200.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Plant Microtechnique and Microscopy</h2><p>Plant microtechnique has generated renewed interest in recent years, due in part to the need for molecular biologists to visualize a gene or gene product in the context of the whole plant. <em>Plant Microtechnique and Microscopy</em> offers uniquely in-depth coverage of this reinvigorated field. Thoroughly covering classical aspects of microscope slide preparation, it goes a step beyond all other available manuals by also documenting the theory and practice of modern applications. <br> The text opens with single-page "Quick Start" protocols that provide students with fundamental instructions to complete eight of the most common microtechnique protocols used today. The following sections cover the theory and practice of microtechnique. The traditional paraffin method is demonstrated by explicit step-by-step protocols, and theoretical background is incorporated to give students the tools required to design their own experiments and to interpret existing results. In addition, modern applications such as methacrylate embedding and sectioning, microwave tissue processing, fluorescence histochemistry, and <em>in situ</em> hybridization are discussed in detail. The manual also contains a definitive chapter on microscopy and describes, in both text and diagrams, the optical principles of techniques such as phase contrast and DIC as well as confocal and deconvolution wide-field microscopy. Appendices on laboratory practice (chemical toxicities, common calculations, and buffer tables), an extensive appendix on optics and its application to the microscope, and an extensive bibliography of over 550 references are also included. Ideal for courses in plant biology, <em>Plant Microtechnique and Microscopy</em> also serves as an indispensable reference for all students of microscopy, histology, and histological technique. It is a valuable addition to every biological laboratory.</p><p>Steven E. Ruzin is at University of California, Berkeley."Extremely well done.

Now he is back, roaming his beloved south country in the disguise of a highwayman.Georgette Heyer (16 August 1902 &#x2013; 4 July 1974) was a British historical romance and detective fiction novelist. Her writing career began in 1921, when she turned a story for her younger brother into the novel The Black Moth. In 1925 Heyer married George Ronald Rougier, a mining engineer. The couple spent several years living in Tanganyika Territory and Macedonia before returning to England in 1929. After her novel These Old Shades became popular despite its release during the General Strike, Heyer determined that publicity was not necessary for good sales. For the rest of her life, she refused to grant interviews, telling a friend: "My private life concerns no one but myself and my family."</p><h2>Lucid Dreaming: The Paradox of Consciousness During Sleep</h2><p>Lucid dreams are dreams in which a person becomes aware that they are dreaming. They are different from ordinary dreams, not just because of the dreamer's awareness that they are dreaming, but because lucid dreams are often strikingly realistic and may be emotionally charged to the point of elation.<br> Celia Green and Charles McCreery have written a unique introduction to lucid dreams that will appeal to the specialist and general reader alike. The authors explore the experience of lucid dreaming, relate it to other experiences such as out-of-the-body experiences (to which they see it as closely related) and apparitions, and look at how lucid dreams can be induced and controlled. They explore their use for therapeutic purposes such as counteracting nightmares. Their study is illustrated throughout with many case histories.</p><p><b>Celia Green</b> is the Director of the Institute of Psychophysical Research, Oxford. <b>Charles McCreery</b> is Research Officer at the Institute of Psychophysical Research.<strong>`The book is highly recommended as an interesting read, a useful source book, and as a sensitive yet scientifically sound approach to these fringe phenomena.'</strong> - <em>The Irish Psychologist</em><br><br><strong>`...this is an interesting and valuable book.

They are the physical embodiment of the artist's creative vision and a reflection of the historical context in which they were used.<br> This latest volume in the popular Guide to Imagery series discusses the materials and processes used in eight media: painting, drawing, printmaking, sculpture, mosaics, ceramics, glass, and metalwork. Within each of these categories, Antonella Fuga examines the range of materials and techniques that have developed over the centuries. For instance, in the chapter on drawing, she analyzes the use of charcoal, red chalk, and pastels, among other media. Capsule descriptions in the margins list essential information about the subject under discussion, and details of the artworks employed as examples are called out. The book concludes with a brief overview of contemporary techniques.<br> Richly illustrated with artworks from many of the world's important museums, this book provides art enthusiasts with new insights into the creation of many of the world's great masterpieces.</p><p><br><strong>Antonella Fuga</strong> is an art historian specializing in the field of decorative arts.<br></p><h2>History of Food</h2><p>This wide-ranging and comprehensive reference history covers in one volume the history of foodstuffs, the story of cuisine and the social history of eating.

Distinguished philosopher John Cooper traces how, for many ancient thinkers, philosophy was not just to be studied or even used to solve particular practical problems. Rather, philosophy--not just ethics but even logic and physical theory--was literally to be lived. Yet there was great disagreement about how to live philosophically: philosophy was not one but many, mutually opposed, ways of life. Examining this tradition from its establishment by Socrates in the fifth century BCE through Plotinus in the third century CE and the eclipse of pagan philosophy by Christianity, <i>Pursuits of Wisdom</i> examines six central philosophies of living--Socratic, Aristotelian, Stoic, Epicurean, Skeptic, and the Platonist life of late antiquity.</p><br><p> The book describes the shared assumptions that allowed these thinkers to conceive of their philosophies as ways of life, as well as the distinctive ideas that led them to widely different conclusions about the best human life. Clearing up many common misperceptions and simplifications, Cooper explains in detail the Socratic devotion to philosophical discussion about human nature, human life, and human good; the Aristotelian focus on the true place of humans within the total system of the natural world; the Stoic commitment to dutifully accepting Zeus's plans; the Epicurean pursuit of pleasure through tranquil activities that exercise perception, thought, and feeling; the Skeptical eschewal of all critical reasoning in forming their beliefs; and, finally, the late Platonist emphasis on spiritual concerns and the eternal realm of Being.</p><br><br><p> <i>Pursuits of Wisdom</i> is essential reading for anyone interested in understanding what the great philosophers of antiquity thought was the true purpose of philosophy--and of life.</p></p><p><p>"Since Socrates, philosophy has been concerned with how we ought to live. But the sense in which philosophy must be an ineluctably practical activity has become obscured. How could philosophy have ever conceived of itself as centrally concerned with its own therapeutic value? In <i>Pursuits of Wisdom</i>, John Cooper brings this crucial question back to life. This marvelous book will shape the way we think about and engage with ancient philosophical traditions."<b>--Jonathan Lear, University of Chicago</b></p><p>"With unparalleled learning, argumentative depth, and great originality, Cooper presents a thorough rethinking of the major Greek moral philosophers. He revitalizes their visions of philosophy as a way of life and shows how they present a powerful challenge to current moral philosophy. The Greeks will never look the same again."<b>--J. B. Schneewind, author of <i>The Invention of Autonomy: A History of Modern Moral Philosophy</i></b></p><p>"John Cooper has had a profound impact on the scholarly study of ancient Greek and Roman philosophy, particularly in its moral dimension. In this new work, he introduces this period to a far wider audience. His sympathy and enthusiasm for the pursuits of wisdom in antiquity, and the subtlety of his understanding of these philosophical schools, will make this book a classic of its kind."<b>--Richard Kraut, author of <i>What Is Good and Why: The Ethics of Well-Being</i></b></p><p>"The product of a lifetime of study and thought, <i>Pursuits of Wisdom</i> is a detailed and rigorous analysis of the foundations of the major schools of ancient ethics in the overall philosophical systems of their authors. John Cooper's masterwork will thus be indispensable for every student of ancient philosophy in general as well as ancient ethics. But Cooper's study is also indispensable for all students of modern ethics since so much of it originates in these ancient schools. In other words, Cooper's book is simply indispensable."<b>--Paul Guyer, University of Pennsylvania</b></p><p>"This book not only discusses philosophy as a way of life, but manifests many of the virtues such a life might be hoped to embody. There is scarcely an instance in which Cooper's sureness of grasp, vivacity of expression, or clarity of purpose falters. The book invites a wide readership, and should receive it."<b>--C.D.C.

Several nights each week, he had night visions more vivid than movies and spiritual dreams so real he could smell the fragrance of heaven. Muriel never stirred. She had to get her rest so she could fix his breakfast. Sam's lawncare equipment ran on gasoline; he needed eggs, sausage, and biscuits with gravy before facing another day. </p> <p> Sam rolled over and opened his blue eyes. He ran his hand over his closely cropped white hair and reached for the tattered notebook on the nightstand beside the bed. Some of the pages listed information about customers: the Smiths wanted their grass cut and patio edged before a party on Friday night, the Blevinses had decided to plant day lilies along the back of their property line. Other sheets recorded what Sam had seen and heard during the night: faces of people who lived in Shelton with diverse needs that ranged from salvation for a wayward child to money for an overdue car payment. Several pages contained crude drawings of strange images without easy interpretation. Notes, questions, and Bible verses filled the margins. </p> <p> Beside the notebook was a picture of Sam and Muriel taken forty-three years earlier. It was their second wedding anniversary. Sam, wearing his Marine Corps dress uniform, stood unsmiling and stern next to his short, curly-haired wife. The soldier in the photo didn't have the large, round belly of the man in the bed nor the twinkle that lit his blue eyes. Those changes came later. Muriel's light brown hair remained curly and her figure trim, but her tanned face was now lined with wrinkles that were the road map to a hundred different ways to smile. </p> <p> Sam sat up and rested his feet on the threadbare rug that covered part of the bedroom floor. He opened the notebook to a blank page. At the top he wrote the date and the words <em>Within three months you'll see your son</em>. He shuffled into the living room. Family photos on the walls recorded the life of Matthew Miller from cradle to manhood. </p> <p> Tragedy was no stranger to the Miller family. Matthew, an Army medic, had died in Somalia. His pictures stopped with a grainy photo taken at dusk in front of a field hospital. Mountains without trees rose in the background. </p> <p> Sam went into the kitchen and looked out the window above the sink. Muriel could wash a fifty-cent plastic plate and enjoy a million-dollar view. Their small house rested atop a knoll positioned like a step stool before the Blue Ridge Mountains. In the early light, Sam could see heavy frost on the grass and wispy ice on the trees in the distance. He leaned over and smelled the crisp morning air through a narrow gap at the bottom of the window. Weather ruled his business, and winter's schedule was less rigorous. When spring arrived, daffodils would jump out of the ground in clumps of yellow celebration all across the backyard, and Sam would be out the door to greet them with the first rays of the sun. </p> <p> Sam always made the morning coffee. He could drink it strong and black, but Muriel liked it so diluted with milk and sugar that it could be served to a child. Sam made the coffee weak. Later, he'd get a strong cup at the Minute Market. The coffee started dripping into the pot, and he returned to the bedroom. Muriel was out of bed and wrapped in her housecoat. Sam leaned over and kissed the top of her head. She responded by patting him on his fuzzy right cheek. </p> <p> "It's time for my bear to come out of hibernation," she said. "Are you going to shave this morning?" </p> <p> "Yep, then take tomorrow off before church on Sunday." </p> <p> *** </p> <p> Sam showered and scraped his chin free of stubble. Buttoning his shirt, he could smell the sausage in the skillet. Muriel rarely bought sausage at the store; she canned it fresh each fall like her mother and grandmother before her. Sam didn't raise pigs, but he knew a man who did. Homemade sausage seasoned with the perfect blend of sage and pepper couldn't be compared to meat from a factory wrapped in a plastic tube. The smoky smell of sausage in the skillet reminded Sam of boyhood breakfasts cooked on an open fire in the woods. His stomach rumbled in anticipation. </p> <p> The cupboard at the Miller house didn't look like a grocery store shelf. Mason jars of green beans, tomatoes, okra, squash, and yellow corn cut from the cob filled the narrow space. Sam's garden was legendary. Two acres on the flat spot at the bottom of the driveway produced more than enough to feed the Millers and provided extra income through the sale of fresh produce to Sam's customers. Mrs. Sellers loved to eat Sam's sun-ripened tomatoes like apples. </p> <p> Sam came into the kitchen, gave Muriel a hug, and rubbed his cheek against hers. </p> <p> "How's that?" he asked. </p> <p> "Much better. The biscuits are in the oven." </p> <p> "I want to take a sausage biscuit to Barry Porter," Sam said. "He's going to deliver two loads of pine bark mulch to a job this morning." </p> <p> Sam sat at the small kitchen table and watched Muriel's morning routine. Every movement had meaning. She didn't waste energy or ingredients. Sam picked up a jar of molasses and tipped it so the amber liquid rolled to one side. </p> <p> "How is Barry's boy doing?" Muriel asked. </p> <p> Sam returned the molasses to its place on the vinyl tablecloth. </p> <p> "He ran off with a married woman to Florida. He's eating slop and calling it steak, but I saw him turning toward home the other night. I'm going to remind Barry to keep looking down the road and welcome him back when he repents." </p> <p> Muriel opened the oven door and took out four golden biscuits. When Matthew was a teenager, she baked six to eight biscuits that always disappeared before the male members of the family went out the front door. </p> <p> "Why don't you take Barry two biscuits?" she suggested. "You eat one, and I'll nibble on the other." </p> <p> Sam scratched his head. "Only one for me? I don't want to pass out while spreading the mulch around Mrs. Smith's patio. I need all my strength to lift that shovel." </p> <p> Muriel turned her back to him as she put the sausage on a clean serving plate and sprinkled flour and pepper into the skillet for the gravy. </p> <p> "I'm thinking about the extra weight these biscuits and sausage are causing around that stomach of yours," she said. "You know your cholesterol is inching up, and Dr. Murray told you to watch your diet." </p> <p> Sam's mouth dropped open, and he stared at her back for a moment. "Are you serious?" </p> <p> Muriel turned around with a serious look on her face. "I love babying you, but sometimes I feel guilty fixing what you want all the time." </p> <p> Sam grinned. "Don't worry. The gravy cuts the calories in half." </p> <p> "We won't argue about it this morning, but I'm not fixing fried chicken tonight. I found a recipe for broiled chicken that sounds real tasty. It uses some of the herbs I dried last summer." </p> <p> "Sounds great. The touch of your loving hands is the key to a good meal." </p> <p> Muriel shook her head. "For a country boy, you're a smooth talker." </p> <p> After all the food was on the table, she sat down across from him. They bowed their heads. </p> <p> Sam prayed for Barry's son, moved into his usual blessing over the meal, and concluded with, "And Master, please take all the cholesterol out of this fine breakfast. Amen." </p> <p> "Your health is not a joke," Muriel said when he finished. "I want to keep you with me as long as possible." </p> <p> Sam reached across and put his weathered hand on top of hers. "And I don't want either of us to leave a moment before Papa's perfect time." </p> <p> After breakfast, Sam put on a heavy coat and went outside while Muriel washed the dishes. The sun was a large yellow ball in the east, and the frost was in full retreat across the yard, exposing the dead grass. Without any wind blowing, the mountain air would warm up rapidly. The coat, hat, and gloves would keep Sam comfortable until he started working. He filled an orange cooler with water from a back porch sink supplied by pipes prevented from freezing by thick insulation wrapped around them. </p> <p> Sam kept the utility trailer he used to haul his equipment in a small storage shed. Parked in front of the shed was a dented red pickup truck with the words "Sam Miller - Lawn Maintenance" written on both doors in white paint. Underneath was Sam's phone number. The boy who painted the advertisement on the truck did a neat job. Three years later, the letters and numbers were only chipped in a few places. </p> <p> Sam unlocked the door of the shed and went inside. The familiar odors of gasoline and dry grass greeted him. Sam owned a large commercial mower, a regular push mower for trimming, and an edger. He did all the maintenance on the equipment himself. The past week, he'd rebuilt the engine in the commercial mower so it would be ready for the spring season. He placed a rake, shovel, mattock, and other hand tools in a rack toward the front of the trailer and secured everything with ...</p></p><h2>The NSTA Quick-Reference Guide to the NGSS, K-12</h2><p>Since the release of the first draft of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), NSTA has been at the forefront in promoting the standards and helping science educators become familiar with and learn to navigate this exciting but complex document. Later, when the final version was released and states began adopting the standards, NSTA started to develop resources that would assist educators with their implementation. Along the way, NSTA learned that even the simplest of resources, like a one-page cheat sheet, can be extremely useful. Many of those tools are collected here, including a two-page cheat sheet that describes the practices, core ideas, and crosscutting concepts that make up the three dimensions described in A Framework for K 12 Science Education; an Inside the Box graphic that spells out all of the individual sections of text that appear on a page of the NGSS; a Venn diagram comparing the practices in NGSS, Common Core State Standards, Mathematics, and Common Core State Standards, English Language Arts; and matrices showing how the NGSS are organized by topic and disciplinary core idea. This guide also provides the appropriate performance expectations; disciplinary core ideas; practices; crosscutting concepts; connections to engineering, technology, and applications of science; and connections to nature of science. It is designed to be used with the NGSS. The book s emphasis is on easy. Find the parts of the standards most relevant to you, acquaint yourself with the format, and find out what each of the different parts means. The NSTA Quick-Reference Guides to the NGSS are also available in grade-specific versions one each for elementary, middle, and high school. These Quick-Reference Guides are indispensable to science teachers at all levels, as well as to administrators, curriculum developers, and teacher educators.</p><p></p><h2>Public Relations Writing and Media Techniques (7th Edition)</h2><p><p>The most comprehensive and up-to-date public relations writing text available has just been updated in its 7th edition.

Paul Getty Museum)</h2><p>Isolated in the remote Egyptian desert, at the base of Mount Sinai, sits the oldest continuously inhabited monastery in the Christian world. The Holy Monastery of Saint Catherine at Sinai holds the most important collection of Byzantine icons remaining today. This catalogue, published in conjuction with the exhibition <em>Holy Image, Hallowed Ground: Icons from Sinai</em>, on view at the J. Paul Getty Museum from November 14, 2006, to March 4, 2007, features forty-three of the monastery's extremely rare--and rarely exhibited--icons and six manuscripts still little-known to the world at large.<br> The exhibition and catalogue bring to life the central role of the icon in Byzantine religious practices. Themes include the icon's status as holy object, the ways in which the icon sanctified the place of worship, and the monks' quest for the holy. The Greek Orthodox monastery at Mount Sinai not only functioned as a major pilgrimage site for centuries but was also a cultural crossroads at the center of the shifting sands of ecclesiastical and secular politics. The accompanying essays explore how the monastery's contact with the outside world, through pilgrimage, resulted in aesthetic exchanges between the monastery and Coptic, Crusader, and Islamic art; and between the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic communities in Europe.</p><p><br><strong>Robert S.

B. Jackson Prize from the Association of American Geographers</p><p>Three centuries ago, the Los Angeles River meandered through marshes and forests of willow and sycamore. Trout spawned in its waters and grizzly bears roamed its shores. The bountiful environment the river helped create supported one of the largest concentrations of Indians in North America. Today, the river is made almost entirely of concrete. Chain-link fence and barbed wire line its course. Shopping carts and trash litter its channel. Little water flows in the river most of the year, and nearly all that does is treated sewage and oily street runoff. On much of its course, the river looks more like a deserted freeway than a river. </p><p>The river's contemporary image belies its former character and its importance to the development of Southern California. Los Angeles would not exist were it not for the river, and the river was crucial to its growth. Recognizing its past and future potential, a potent movement has developed to revitalize its course. <i>The Los Angeles River</i> offers the first comprehensive account of a river that helped give birth to one of the world's great cities, significantly shaped its history, and promises to play a key role in its future.</p></p><p>Why is the historic center of Los Angeles located where it is, 15 miles from the ocean and 10 miles from the San Gabriel Mountains, on an arid plain? The answer is the Los Angeles River, which once flowed freely across that flat land. In his book, <i>The Los Angeles River: Its Life, Death, and Possible Rebirth</i>, Blake Gumprecht points out that before the course of the river was paved, Hollywood and Beverly Hills were marshland and that in flood years, the river carried as much water as the Mississippi.<p> "The destruction of the river had begun half a century before the first concrete was poured," Gumprecht writes, "when the river ... began to be viewed not as a giver of life or a thing of beauty, but as a dumping ground--for horse carcasses, petroleum waste, and the city's garbage." The river, he adds, was also viewed as a mere vehicle for a commodity, water, and a vehicle that could be improved with the addition of channels, culverts, and reservoirs. Such changes made the wide-scale development of the Los Angeles region possible, but they destroyed the living river. Now, years later, environmental activists are pressing to restore the river to something of its former self--and their efforts, if successful, will again alter the course of regional history.</p><p> The Los Angeles River has figured widely in many ecological studies of Southern California; in historical work it has figured largely as a backdrop. Gumprecht grants the river close attention as a thing unto itself, one that has affected many other aspects of the area's social, economic, and environmental history. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>"Once the very soul of the city's landscape, the Los Angeles River is now just a concrete storm sewer. But, as Gumprecht argues in this landmark history, its resurrection may become the unifying civic crusade of the next decade." --- Mike Davis, author of <i>City of Quartz: Excavating the Future in Los Angeles.</i></p><h2>The Complete Vizsla</h2><p>The Vizsla is said to be a distinguished looking dog of aristocratic bearing, sought-after by sportsmen and, in many ways, the ideal working gundog combining all three disciplines of hunting, pointing and retrieving.

Wells.</b><i> &nbsp;<br><br>A lonely island in the Pacific. The sinister scientist who rules it. And the strange beings who dwell there...</i><br><br> This is the scenario for H. G. Wells&#x2019;s haunting classic, one of his most intriguing and visionary novels. Living in the late nineteenth century and facing the impact of Darwin&#x2019;s theory of evolution, Wells wrote this chilling masterpiece about the characteristics of beasts blurring as the animals turn into men. Dr. Moreau, a scientist expelled from his homeland for his cruel vivisection experiments, finds a deserted island that gives him the freedom to continue torturous transplantations and create hideous creatures with manlike intelligence. But as the brutally enforced order on Moreau&#x2019;s island dissolves, the true consequences of his experiments emerge, and his creations revert to beasts more shocking than nature could devise.<br><br> A genius of his time, H. G. Wells foresaw the use of what he called the &#x201c;atom bomb,&#x201d; the practice of gene-splicing, and men landing on the moon. Now, when these have become part of everyday life, his dark fable serves as a compelling reminder of the horrors that reckless experiments with nature can produce.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>With an Introduction&nbsp;by Nita A. Farahany<b>&nbsp;<br></b>and an Afterword by Dr. John L. Flynn</b></p><p>A shipwreck in the South Seas, a palm-tree paradise where a mad doctor conducts vile experiments, animals that become human and then "beastly" in ways they never were before--it's the stuff of high adventure. It's also a parable about Darwinian theory, a social satire in the vein of Jonathan Swift (<i>Gulliver's Travels</i>), and a bloody tale of horror. Or, as H. G. Wells himself wrote about this story, "<i>The Island of Dr. Moreau</i> is an exercise in youthful blasphemy. Now and then, though I rarely admit it, the universe projects itself towards me in a hideous grimace. It grimaced that time, and I did my best to express my vision of the aimless torture in creation." This colorful tale by the author of <i>The Time Machine</i>, <i>The Invisible Man</i>, and <i>The War of the Worlds</i> lit a firestorm of controversy at the time of its publication in 1896.Founded in 1906 by J.M.

These states have small nuclear arsenals, often face multiple active conflicts, and sometimes have weak institutions. How do these nuclear states&#x2015;and potential future ones&#x2015;manage their nuclear forces and influence international conflict? Examining the reasoning and deterrence consequences of regional power nuclear strategies, this book demonstrates that these strategies matter greatly to international stability and it provides new insights into conflict dynamics across important areas of the world such as the Middle East, East Asia, and South Asia.</p><p>Vipin Narang identifies the diversity of regional power nuclear strategies and describes in detail the posture each regional power has adopted over time. Developing a theory for the sources of regional power nuclear strategies, he offers the first systematic explanation of why states choose the postures they do and under what conditions they might shift strategies. Narang then analyzes the effects of these choices on a state's ability to deter conflict. Using both quantitative and qualitative analysis, he shows that, contrary to a bedrock article of faith in the canon of nuclear deterrence, the acquisition of nuclear weapons does not produce a uniform deterrent effect against opponents. Rather, some postures deter conflict more successfully than others.</p><p><i>Nuclear Strategy in the Modern Era</i> considers the range of nuclear choices made by regional powers and the critical challenges they pose to modern international security.</p></p><p><p>"This excellent book offers a novel typology of nuclear postures and a theory that explains why states adopt certain postures but not others, before assessing the consequences of postures for deterrence. An exemplary blend of theory and qualitative and quantitative evidence, its conclusions have wide-ranging implications for the way we think about nuclear deterrence."<b>--Alexander Downes, George Washington University</b></p><p>"This book makes a major contribution to our understanding of the nuclear challenges that we currently face. Narang argues that the theories developed during the Cold War cannot explain the nuclear policies of regional powers. To fill this important gap, he convincingly lays out three distinct nuclear postures available to regional powers and he questions conventional wisdom to show that a state's nuclear posture significantly influences its deterrence effect."<b>--Charles Glaser, George Washington University</b></p><p>"With the end of the Cold War, the nuclear postures of countries other than the United States and Russia are increasingly central for theory and policy, but our knowledge of these postures has been deficient. Showing that states have tailored their stances to different internal and external situations, Narang combines rich empirical research and careful theorizing to add greatly to our understanding of deterrence."<b>--Robert Jervis, author of <i>The Meaning of the Nuclear Revolution</i></b></p><p>"Vipin Narang's study of the causes and consequences of different states' nuclear weapons postures is a significant contribution to the literature on the causes of military doctrine, as well as the literature on both nuclear proliferation and deterrence theory. Narang's interpretations are novel and thought provoking, and he skillfully combines rich case study work with sophisticated statistical tests."<b>--Scott D.

Inspired in part by the eighteenth-century culture of sensibility and in part by religious models, these relationships were not only important to the personal happiness of those involved but also had broader social, religious, and political significance. </p><p>Godbeer shows that in the aftermath of Independence, patriots drafted a central place for male friendship in their social and political blueprint for the new republic. American revolutionaries stressed the importance of the family in the era of self-government, reimagining it in ways appropriate to a new and democratized era. They thus shifted attention away from patriarchal authority to a more egalitarian model of brotherly collaboration.

Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, George and Ira Gershwin, Rodgers and Hart--even today these giants remain household names, their musicals regularly revived, their methods and styles analyzed and imitated, and their songs the bedrock of jazz and cabaret. In <em>The Poets of Tin Pan Alley</em> Philip Furia offers a unique new perspective on these great songwriters, showing how their poetic lyrics were as important as their brilliant music in shaping a golden age of American popular song.<br> Furia writes with great perception and understanding as he explores the deft rhymes, inventive imagery, and witty solutions these songwriters used to breathe new life into rigidly established genres. He devotes full chapters to all the greats, including Irving Berlin, Lorenz Hart, Ira Gershwin, Cole Porter, Oscar Hammerstain II, Howard Dietz nd E.Y. Harburg, Dorothy Fields and Leo Robin, and Johnny Mercer. Furia also offers a comprehensive survey of other lyricists who wrote for the sheet-music industry, Broadway, Hollywood, and Harlem nightclub revues. This was the era that produced <em>The New Yorker</em>, Don Marquis, Dorothy Parker, and E.B. White--and Furia places the lyrics firmly in this fascinating historical context. In these pages, the lyrics emerge as an imporant element of American modernism, as the lyricists, like the great modernist poets, took the American vernacular and made it sing.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em><br> Philip Furia is Professor of English and American Studies at the University of Minnesota.

Without warning an insurgent popped up, his weapon raised. At the handler's command, the dog charged their attacker. There was the flash of steel, the blur of fur, and the sound of a single shot; the handler watched his dog take a bullet. During the weeks it would take the dog to heal, the handler never left its side. The dog had saved his life. Loyal and courageous, dogs are truly man's best friend on the battlefield. While the soldiers may not always feel comfortable calling the bond they form love, the emotions involved are strong and complicated. In <i>War Dogs</i>, Rebecca Frankel offers a riveting mix of on-the-ground reporting, her own hands-on experiences in the military working dog world, and a look at the science of dogs' special abilities-from their amazing noses and powerful jaws to their enormous sensitivity to the emotions of their human companions. The history of dogs in the US military is long and rich, from the spirit-lifting mascots of the Civil War to the dogs still leading patrols hunting for IEDs today. Frankel not only interviewed handlers who deployed with dogs in wars from Vietnam to Iraq, but top military commanders, K-9 program managers, combat-trained therapists who brought dogs into war zones as part of a preemptive measure to stave off PTSD, and veterinary technicians stationed in Bagram. She makes a passionate case for maintaining a robust war-dog force. In a post-9/11 world rife with terrorist threats, nothing is more effective than a bomb-sniffing dog and his handler. With a compelling cast of humans and animals, this moving book is a must read for all dog lovers-military and otherwise.</p></p><p>Rebecca Frankel is deputy editor at <i>Foreign Policy</i>.

For more than twenty-five years, Malone has dominated the cable television industry, shaping the world of entertainment and communications, first with his cable company TCI and later with Liberty Media. Written with Malone's unprecedented cooperation, the engaging narrative brings this controversial capitalist and businessman to life. Cable Cowboy is at once a penetrating portrait of Malone's complex persona, and a captivating history of the cable TV industry. Told in a lively style with exclusive details, the book shows how an unassuming copper strand started as a backwoods antenna service and became the digital nervous system of the U.S., an evolution that gave U.S. consumers the fastest route to the Internet. Cable Cowboy reveals the forces that propelled this pioneer to such great heights, and captures the immovable conviction and quicksilver mind that have defined John Malone throughout his career.</p><p>John Malone's rise to power within cable television was wild and improbable, and it mirrors how the nation's network of high-speed cable wires-the most sophisticated in the world-came to be.<br> <br> Recognized now as one of the great unsung business titans of the information age and vilified as the "Darth Vader" of the cable-TV industry, John Malone cut the deals and created the companies that have defined modern entertainment and communications in our lives.<br> <br> In Cable Cowboy: John Malone and the Rise of the Modern Cable Business, author Mark Robichaux paints a riveting portrait of Malone and details the competitive struggles of the industry through the eyes of the man who would come to dominate it.<br> <br> Vivid detail and a colorful narrative bring Malone's story to life as the intelligent and opinionated thirty-one-year old passes on the opportunity of a lifetime in New York City to take control of a tiny debt-ridden cable-TV company in Denver known as Tele-Communications Inc. As Malone transforms his beloved TCI into a media colossus over three decades, he, too, is transformed, from an East Coast, Ivy League student and sailor, into a cunning and commanding cable cowboy. Malone and TCI jump into a ruthless corporate battle to control the world's living rooms amid an onslaught of new technology and government rules.<br> <br> You'll see Malone navigate an uncharted industry, relying on deal-making savvy, a brotherhood of cable entrepreneurs, and a passion to create wealth that bordered on pure instinct.

In a way that neither condemns nor condones drug use, the authors describe the likely effects of each drug and discuss precautions and alternatives, allowing readers to make informed and intelligent choices. Illustrations.</p><p>Andrew Weil, M.D., has degrees in biology and medicine from Harvard University. Author of the best-selling Spontaneous Healing and Eight Weeks to Optimum Health, he traveled the world experiencing and studying healers and healing systems and has earned an international reputation as an expert on alternative medicine, mind-body interactions, and medical botany. He is the associate director of the Division of Social Perspectives in Medicine and the director of the Program in Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona in Tucson.Since drug use has occurred throughout history and within most cultures, the authors in this updated edition of their original work ( LJ 3/15/83) believe that "education based on truthful information is the only solution to the drug problem." In straightforward language, Weil and Rosen distinguish between drug use and drug abuse and stress the importance of developing a "good relationship" with drugs. Because the authors do not condemn drug use (legal or illegal), their volume may be considered unorthodox by some. Each chapter deals with a specific class of drugs, such as stimulants, depressants, and psychedelics, and describes the different effects of drugs in each category. At the end of each chapter are some precautions for using those drugs and also suggested readings for more information. Aimed at young people and their parents and teachers, this book offers an alternative way of looking at drug use.

So claimed a Chicago newspaper reporter in the 1920s of Mabel Dodge Luhan, who attracted leading literary and intellectual figures to her circle for over four decades. Not only was she mistress of a grand salon, an American Madame de Stael, she was also a leading symbol of the New Woman: sexually emancipated, self-determining, and in control of her destiny. In many ways, her life is the story of America's emergence from the Victorian age.</p><p>Lois Rudnick has written a unique and definitive biography that examines all aspects of Mabel Dodge Luhan's real and imagined lives, drawing on fictional portraits of Mabel, including those by D. H. Lawrence, Carl Van Vechten, and Gertrude Stein, as well as on Mabel's own voluminous memoirs, letters, and fiction. Rudnick not only assesses Mabel as muse to men of genius but also considers her seriously as a writer, activist, and spirit of the age.</p><p>This biography will appeal not just to cultural historians but to any woman who has loved and lived with men who are artists and rebels.

It is not uncommon then for those with unresolved grief to lean toward addictions or dangerous behaviors or other forms of self-destruction. In <i>Unattended Sorrow</i>, Levine addresses the grief from fresh loss but also attends to the pain and troubles caused by the unresolved anguish, sadness and delayed stress than can accumulate over a lifetime. He notes that we may never entirely overcome sorrows but we can confront them with mercy and self-acceptance that smooths the path to healing the heart. </p></p><p><p>Stephen Levine was the bestselling author of many books. With his wife Ondrea, he counseled terminally ill people and their loved ones for than 30 years. His renowned work in grief counseling inspired radio segments and interviews as well as magazine articles including pieces in <i>O: The Oprah Magazine</i>, <i>Psychology Today</i> and the <i>Utne Reader</i>. He and Ondrea lived for many years in the mountains of New Mexico, where Ondrea still lives today. </p><p>&#x201c;...All of his easy-to-follow suggestions involve extending kindness and forgiveness to the self, which, Levine says, will lead to the practice of dealing with others in the spirit of mercy and love. Although, as Levine acknowledges, the healing process is slow, opening the pain-filled heart can lead to the unfolding of a new life.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Publisher's Weekly</i>, starred review</p> <p>&#x201c;Stephen&#x2019;s work is magic.

[Wilson and DiIulio's work in the public sector over the past years enhances their impressive academic credentials. The fact that they have worked for both Republicans and Democrats and the evenhanded manner with which they have covered the major topics in the text allays any reservations that this text doesn't give every side of an issue fair treatment.... I stand in awe of how Wilson and DiIulio are able to package so much solid information in such few pages.... This is as solid and intellectually honest a textbook as one could hope for. It should be the standard by which all others are measured. The emphasis on students using their critical thinking skills to reach conclusions on issues of the day provides a firm foundation.... I think that this is the finest American Government textbook available today.

In the charming town of Carlisle, children and grown-ups alike flock from miles around to hear spellbinding tales. And when Bev King and his younger brother Felix arrive for the summer, they, too, are captivated by the Story Girl. Whether she&#39;s leading them on exciting misadventures or narrating timeless stories -- from the scary &#34;Tale of the Family Ghost&#34; to the fanciful &#34;How Kissing Was Discoverd&#34; to the bittersweet &#34;The Blue Chest of Rachel Ward&#34; -- the Story Girl has her audience hanging on every word.Born in 1874 in Prince Edward Island, Canada, Lucy Maud Montgomery showed an early flair for storytelling. She soon began to have her writing published in papers and magazines, and when she died in Toronto in 1942, she had written more than twenty novels and a large number of short stories. Most of her books are set in P.E.I., which she loved very much and wrote of most beautifully. <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>, her most popular work, has been translated into more than forty languages, made into a film several times over, and has had continuing success as a stage play.</p><h2>Making a Living in the Middle Ages: The People of Britain 850-1520</h2><p>Dramatic social and economic change during the middle ages altered the lives of the people of Britain in far-reaching ways, from the structure of their families to the ways they made their livings. In this masterly book, preeminent medieval historian Christopher Dyer presents a fresh view of the British economy from the ninth to the sixteenth century and a vivid new account of medieval life. He begins his volume with the formation of towns and villages in the ninth and tenth centuries and ends with the inflation, population rise, and colonial expansion of the sixteenth century. This is a book about ideas and attitudes as well as the material world, and Dyer shows how people regarded the economy and responded to economic change. He examines the growth of towns, the clearing of lands, the Great Famine, the Black Death, and the upheavals of the fifteenth century through the eyes of those who experienced them. He also explores the dilemmas and decisions of those who were making a living in a changing world-from peasants, artisans, and wage earners to barons and monks. Drawing on archaeological and landscape evidence along with more conventional archives and records, the author offers here an engaging survey of British medieval economic history unrivaled in breadth and clarity.</p><p>The New Economic History of Britain Series - Series editor: David Cannadine&#34;This elegant account of the economic history of Britain over seven centuries is an exhilarating book-this is serious history that can be read for pleasure.&#34;-Danny Danziger, Sunday Times (London); &#34;A work of immense ambition and erudition.&#34;-Daniel Snowman, History Today; &#34;[Dyer] offers accessible and cogent introductions to an infinite range of . . . topics, which he knits together into an effective and fascinating patchwork quilt.&#34;-John Hatcher, Times Literary Supplement; A must-read for any thoughtful person interested in medieval Europe or in the transition to the modern social and economic world.&#34;-Robert L.

Ranging from incisive assessments of his political leadership, to explorations of his enigmatic character, to reflections on the mythos that has become inseparable from the man, each of these contributions expands our understanding of Abraham Lincoln and shows why he has been such an object of enduring fascination.Contributions include:* James McPherson on Lincoln the military strategist* Richard Hofstadter on the Lincoln legend* Edmund Wilson on his contribution to American letters* John Hope Franklinon the Emancipation Proclamation* James Horton on Lincoln and race* David M. Potter on the secession* Richard Current on Lincoln&#39;s political genius* Mark Neely on Lincoln and civil liberties.</p><p>SEAN WILENTZ<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is the Dayton-Stockton Professor of History at Princeton University, USA. He regularly writes on history and politics for publications such as&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Los Angeles Times, The New Republic</i>, and <i>Salon.com. </i>His most recent book is <i>The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln</i>.Lincoln&#x2019;s reputation peaked with Carl Sandburg&#x2019;s multivolume biography; inevitably, historians after World War II put that reputation through a wringer of revision and re-revision. From their output, this collection assembles&nbsp;11 essays that are vigorously argued, well-written opinions about Lincoln the person and Lincoln the politician. The opening articles, a 1948 piece by Richard Hofstadter and a 1962 passage by Edmund Wilson, are examples of Lincoln iconoclasm, and the balance of essays address a specific aspect of Lincoln that prompts popular debate. Was his marriage a heaven or hell? A biographer of Mary Lincoln champions the former and disputes historians who argue the latter. What was the responsibility of Lincoln and his party in igniting the Civil War? Several of the essayists tackle this question, followed by others who take up Lincoln&#x2019;s wartime actions on emancipation or military strategy. Estimations of Lincoln&#x2019;s political acumen have risen recently; they may be traced to an astute 1977 essay reprinted here. Readers of popular Lincolnalia will be intrigued by this tome&#x2019;s sampling of professional historians&#x2019; perspectives on the sixteenth U.S. president. --Gilbert Taylor</p><h2>Investigating Astronomy</h2><p>Sparked by the latest developments in astronomy education research, <em>Investigating Astronomy</em> focuses on conceptual understanding, visual literacy, and inquiry-based learning.&nbsp; Tim Slater and Roger Freedman&#x2019;s concise (15 chapter) text explores core topics to show how astronomers study and decipher the universe&#x2019;s underlying processes, helping students approach the subject from a professional scientist&#x2019;s perspective.<br>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Timothy F.

This text, accessible to students at the community college, undergraduate, and, in some cases even beginning graduate school level, outlines the fundamental methods utilized in the research and writing of history. The new edition features a wealth of updates and enhancements, along with the addition of a new chapter addressing the use of film and other non-textual sources by historians&#x2014;for example, how a film like D.

Students are shown how to engage effectively in critical reading, interpreting, note-taking, writing, and revising. The creation of a historiographical essay and a longer research paper are discussed in detail. Methodological matters are interwoven with a discussion of the dynamic nature of history, in which the concept of revisionism is central and reveals that new interpretations of the past are an essential corollary to changing social, political, economic, and cultural structures.

Plautine comedies span a wide range of idioms, extending from saucy adventures in the sex trade with Father as the fall-guy who foots all bills, to the trouncing of bigmouth trooper by Ms. Hot Stuff; from the fairytale wishes come true of faraway foundlings fished up on a surprise romantic shore, to the caricature gospel that re-stages the myth of the birth of the hero, in true panto style, gods and all. <p> Although there is no such creature as a typical Plautus play, this cannily chosen set of excerpts-ranging from the best- to least-known plays-gives a good sense of how a whole script runs, from opening hush, through brisk cameos and spectacular showstoppers, to final bow. John Hendersons energy, wit, and contagious affection for Plautussnappy Latin (which he calls 'Plautin') take the reader along on a whirlwind, laugh-out-loud tour. His combination of commentary, interpretive remarks, and attention to staging and metatheatrics make this edition a perfect introduction to Plautus, and an incentive for further reading. </p><p> Special Features </p><p> * Introduction that is as lively as it is informative<br> * 616 lines of unadapted Latin text from eleven Plautus plays: Asinaria 746-809, Amphitruo 361-462, Captiui 1029-36, Casina 780-854 and 1012-18, Cistellaria 203-29, Curculio 462-86, Menaechmi 77-109 and 351-69, Poenulus 1-45 and 541-66, Pseudolus 1-2 and 394-414, Rudens 938-1044, and Truculentus 482-548<br> * Notes at the back<br> * Map and five photos<br> * Bibliography and further reading for each play<br> * Appendix on meter<br> * Guide to pronunciation of proper names<br> * Online Latin text, marked for reading aloud (download pdf)<br> * Complete vocabulary<br></p><p>For over 30 years Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers has produced the highest quality Latin and ancient Greek books.

He teaches like crazy, but has also written wicked books and weird articles across the range of classical topics, including a fun edition with text, translation, and commentary on Plautus, Asinaria: the one with the asses (2006). His DPhil Oxon was on the fabulous Phaedrus, and his scholarly output since has centered on reacting enthusiastically to Roman texts, with quirky books on Seneca, Statius, Pliny, Juvenal, and Isidore, and storming articles on Latin poetry and history collected in Fighting for Rome: Poets and Caesars, History and Civil War (1998), with other outrages collected in Writing down Rome: Satire, Comedy and other Offences in Latin Poetry (1999).Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers is a seminal source of materials for the study of Latin. Two of their newest contributions include John Henderson's <i>A Plautus Reader: Selections from Eleven Plays</i> and Victoria E. Pagan's <i>A Sallust Reader: Selections from Bellum Catilinae, Bellum Iugurthinum, and Historiae</i>. The comedic playwright Plautus and the Roman historian Sallust are significant in studying the culture and history of Rome and serve as ideal sources in the study of Latin for modem students. Enhanced with grammatical and historical notes, maps and photos, and vocabulary, both <i>A Plautus Reader</i> and <i>A Sallust Reader</i> will prove invaluable additions to personal, professional, and academic library Latin Studies reference collections and supplemental reading lists. --James A. Cox, Editor-in-Chief Midwest Book Review Wisconsin Bookwatch: February 2010 The Language Studies Shelf<br><br>GOOD THINGS COME IN SMALL PACKAGES<p> Bolchazy-Carducci has recently commenced launching the first titles in its Latin Reader series, a new collection of innovative high intermediate and advanced Latin readers, specifically designed for college-level study. Under the expert guidance of series editor Ronnie Ancona, Professor of Classics at Hunter College and The Graduate Center, City University of New York, these small, duodecimo-sized paperbacks are intended to introduce authors and genres to students in upper division undergraduate courses. Written by recognized experts, each book will include approximately 500-600 lines of authentic Latin text, accompanied by a thorough introduction, bibliography of suggested reading, annotated commentary, and full vocabulary. There are currently two volumes available, <i>A Lucan Reader: Selections from Civil War</i> (ISBN 978-0865166615) by Susanna Braund and <i>A Terence Reader: Selections from Six Plays</i> (978-0865166783) by William S. Anderson. According to the Bolchazy website, seventeen additional volumes are currently scheduled to be issued. Upcoming authors include Plautus, Sallust, Cicero, Sueconius, Tacitus, Vergil, Caesar, Martial, Apuleius, and Livy. Topics to be covered include Roman Women, Roman Verse Satire, Latin Epic, and Roman Army. Additional authors and themes are under consideration.</p><p>The inaugural volume, <i>A Lucan Reader</i>, is an introduction to the Silver Age epic poem (often referred to as Pharsalia) retelling the events of the Civil War between Julius Caesar and Pompey. Rarely studied by third and fourth-year college Latin students, this reader provides the opportunity for advanced undergraduates to sample some difficult but fascinating Latin. Following a detailed and compelling introduction, Braund has selected high interest passages: the causes of the Civil war, Caesar at the Rubicon, the abandonment of Rome, the necromancy of Erichtho, Pompey's visitation by Julia's ghost, and Caesar in Troy. I have never read Lucan, but now find myself intrigued.</p><p>The second volume, <i>A Terence Reader</i>, released just this summer, is an introduction to Roman Comedy. Following a consistent format, Anderson's introduction provides essential background for students and a brief history of Roman Comedy. He then proceeds to explain what made Terence's plays unique, original and thought-provoking. Selections in this volume include excerpts from Andria, Heauton, Phormia, Hecyra, Eunuchus, and Adelphoe, followed by commentary to put the passages in context and provide grammatical assistance. There is also a helpful appendix, with information regarding comic meters. Fans of comedy will be happy to know that the next volume in the series, to be released later this year, will be <i>A Plautus Reader: Selections from Eleven Plays</i> by John Henderson.</p><p>Given the size of these short readers, teachers and professors should find them useful when customizing a course. Professor Ancona notes that they are ideal for use in combination. I observe that they are inexpensive ($19.95) compared to many college textbooks. Instructors can feel free to mix and match authors and themes to suit their curriculum without causing too much damage to their students' bank accounts. Motivated readers of Latin can sample new authors and themes with expert guidance. Secondary school teachers may even wish to challenge their skilled Advanced Placement students after completing the exam, using some of these selections as a follow-up to the anticipated Caesar/Vergil syllabus. --The Clearing House - Sharon Kazmierski</p></p><h2>The Shadow of a Great Rock: A Literary Appreciation of the King James Bible</h2><p><p>The King James Bible stands at "the sublime summit of literature in English," sharing the honor only with Shakespeare, Harold Bloom contends in the opening pages of this illuminating literary tour. Distilling the insights acquired from a significant portion of his career as a brilliant critic and teacher, he offers readers at last the book he has been writing "all my long life," a magisterial and intimately perceptive reading of the King James Bible as a literary masterpiece.</p><p>Bloom calls it an "inexplicable wonder" that a rather undistinguished group of writers could bring forth such a magnificent work of literature, and he credits William Tyndale as their fountainhead. Reading the King James Bible alongside Tyndale's Bible, the Geneva Bible, and the original Hebrew and Greek texts, Bloom highlights how the translators and editors improved upon&#x2014;or, in some cases, diminished&#x2014;the earlier versions. He invites readers to hear the baroque inventiveness in such sublime books as the Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, and Job, and alerts us to the echoes of the King James Bible in works from the Romantic period to the present day. Throughout, Bloom makes an impassioned and convincing case for reading the King James Bible as literature, free from dogma and with an appreciation of its enduring aesthetic value.</p></p><p>From the Introduction:<br><br>The largest aesthetic paradox of the KJB is its gorgeous exfoliation of the Hebrew original. Evidently the KJB men knew just enough Hebrew to catch the words but not the original music. Their relative ignorance transmuted into splendor because they shared a sense of literary decorum that all subsequent translators seem to lack. Miles Coverdale, bare both of Hebrew and of Greek, set a pattern that Miles Smith perfected. It is another of the many paradoxes of the KJB that its elaborate prose harmonies essentially were inaugurated by Coverdale&#x2019;s intuitive journey into the poems and prophecies his master Tyndale did not live to translate. We have Tyndale&#x2019;s Jonah and a medley of prophetic passages, eleven from Isaiah, in the <i>Epistle Taken out of the Old Testament.</i> How wonderful it would be to have Job, Ecclesiastes, and Jeremiah from the hand of Tyndale, though probably that would have prevented Coverdale&#x2019;s astonishing flair for style and rhythm from manifesting itself. This flair was unsteady, yet at its best it gave us something of the sonority we associate with KJB.<br><br>Tyndale, Coverdale, and the Geneva translators (including their best Hebraist, Gilby) all possessed the gift of literary authority. Their revisionist, Miles Smith, explicitly displays his sense of style in the 1611 preface, &#x201c;The Translators to the Reader,&#x201d; and implicitly stands forth by his editorial responsibility for the ways in which the KJB men handle their inheritance from previous English Bibles. Again paradox intervenes: from Tyndale through KJB the quest is to get closer to the literal sense of the Hebrew, while the consequence is to increase a cognitive music farther and farther away in regard to the Hebrew Bible&#x2019;s relative freedom from metaphors. Since all metaphor is a kind of mistake anyway, even the plain errors of the KJB sometimes add to the resultant splendor.<b>Harold Bloom</b> is Sterling Professor of the Humanities at Yale University.

This time he is helping his animal friends find a home after a storm has blown down the giant oak tree that they had all inhabited. Percy carts them around in his wheelbarrow during the search, but they are unable to find suitable shelter. The wheelbarrow winds up in the lake, and they all row across, where they find an enormous hollow tree at the water's edge. Percy and company then proceed to turn the tree into an animal condo, complete with balconies, stairways, decks, and docks. The story is similar to Inkpen's Kipper (Little, 1992), but not as successful. Butterworth's text is a bit on the wordy side for the intended audience, but he does a nice job on the watercolor illustrations, especially the landscapes. His pictures almost save the book from mediocrity, but not quite. A detachable poster of the tree in its finished, condo form is included. It's too bad that a reduced version of this illustration isn't included at the end of the book. --George Delalis, Oakland Public Library, CA<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sheila Metzner: Form and Fashion</h2><p>The renowned fashion photographer shares her competing nudes and still life&#39;s in this first-ever major retrospective of her remarkable photographic work.</p><p></p><h2>GIS Modeling in Raster</h2><p>This new text is written for the second GIS course taken by Geography majors.

For students of Latin-and teachers, too-they provide an interesting experience.</p><p>In his introduction the editor discusses Ovid?s career, the reputation of the Metamorphoses during Ovid?s time and after, and the various manuscripts that exist or have been known to exist.

This is Jill Stoner's premise for a minor architecture. Her architect's eye tracks differently from most, drawn not to the lauded and iconic but to what she calls &#x201c;the landscape of our constructed mistakes&#x201d;&#x2015;metropolitan hinterlands rife with failed and foreclosed developments, undersubscribed office parks, chain hotels, and abandoned malls. These graveyards of capital, Stoner asserts, may be stripped of their excess and become sites of strategic spatial operations. But first we must dissect and dismantle prevalent architectural mythologies that brought them into being&#x2015;western obsessions with interiority, with the autonomy of the building-object, with the architect's mantle of celebrity, and with the idea of nature as that which is &#x201c;other&#x201d; than the built metropolis. These four myths form the warp of the book.</p><p>Drawing on the literary theory of Gilles Deleuze and F�lix Guattari, Stoner suggests that minor architectures, like minor literatures, emerge from the bottoms of power structures and within the language of those structures. Yet they too are the result of powerful and instrumental forces. Provoked by collective desires, directed by the instability of time, and celebrating contingency, minor architectures may be mobilized within buildings that are oversaturated, underutilized, or perceived as obsolete.</p><p>Stoner's provocative challenge to current discourse veers away from design, through a diverse landscape of cultural theory, contemporary fiction, and environmental ethics. Hers is an optimistic and inclusive approach to a more politicized practice of architecture.</p></p><p>Jill Stoner is Professor of Architecture and Chair of the Center for Jewish Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. Until recently a practicing architect, she has been the recipient of numerous national and international design awards.

In <em>The Invention of Brownstone Brooklyn</em>, Suleiman Osman offers a groundbreaking history of this unexpected transformation. Challenging the conventional wisdom that New York City's renaissance started in the 1990s, Osman locates the origins of gentrification in Brooklyn in the cultural upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s. Gentrification began as a grassroots movement led by young and idealistic white college graduates searching for "authenticity" and life outside the burgeoning suburbs. Where postwar city leaders championed slum clearance and modern architecture, "brownstoners" (as they called themselves) fought for a new romantic urban ideal that celebrated historic buildings, industrial lofts and traditional ethnic neighborhoods as a refuge from an increasingly technocratic society. Osman examines the emergence of a "slow-growth" progressive coalition as brownstoners joined with poorer residents to battle city planners and local machine politicians. But as brownstoners migrated into poorer areas, race and class tensions emerged, and by the 1980s, as newspapers parodied yuppies and anti-gentrification activists marched through increasingly expensive neighborhoods, brownstoners debated whether their search for authenticity had been a success or failure.<br></p><p><br><b>Suleiman Osman </b>is Associate Professor of American Studies at George Washington University.

Osman impresses with sweeping ruminations on the meanings of modernism and what he dubs the 'literature of gentrification' while also remaining grounded in nuts-and-bolts archival research."--<em>Bookforum</em><p></p><br>"A brilliant study of an American 'pro urban ideal,' which opened up just after World War II, when it seemed all America was rejecting cities and their values. Suleiman Osman shows Brooklynites fighting each other for decades. Did anybody win? We can see now, decades later, how intellectually fruitful this fight has been, how it has 'blossomed into a postindustrial slow growth movement' that is still growing."--Marshall Berman, author of <em>All That Is Solid Melts Into Air</em> <br><p></p><br>"Finally we have a history of gentrification that isn't primarily an exercise in identifying good guys and bad guys. And what a history it is! In this superb study, Suleiman Osman gives us a highly readable and well balanced account of the complex forces at work in Brownstone Brooklyn in the 1960s and 70s, a pivotal era for America and its cities. By looking closely at one small part of the urban landscape, Osman has been able to give us one of the most satisfying accounts to date of some of the fundamental shifts in American life in an era when the industrial economy bottomed out, a venerable New Deal coalition collapsed, new activist groups appeared, a new conservatism was born, and American inner city neighborhoods became a crucible for new attitudes about architecture, urban life and the role of place and community activism. In the process we get incisive, often startling, insights into figures we thought we knew."--Robert Bruegmann, author of <em>Sprawl: A Compact History</em><p></p><br>"<em>Inventing Brownstone Brooklyn</em> gives readers a rich and compelling story of competing urban visions. The power and inner contradictions of the gentrification impulse come alive in these pages."--Daniel T. Rodgers, author of <em>Age of Fracture</em><p></p><br>"In this richly nuanced account, Suleiman Osman follows Brooklyn's gentrifiers--small in number but outsized in influence--as they reclaimed brownstones and remade urban space. Osman's discussion of the connections between gentrification, urban reform politics, and the 1960s counterculture is especially illuminating."--Thomas J. Sugrue, University of Pennsylvania<p></p><br>"This fine-grained history portrays gentrifiers as the first Moderns who are both rooted in the growth of big business and the professions and rebelling against the soulless city built by corporations and the state. Osman adroitly traces the paradoxes of gentrification from an elusive search for authenticity to the fears of the urban middle class."--Sharon Zukin, author of <em>Naked City: The Death and Life of Authentic Urban Places</em><p></p><br>"Osman...sheds new light on the history of the Brownstone belt and how it began to convey the charm and authenticity gentrifiers admire so much.

He was a miner with a knack for finding veins of valuable material even in old, worked-out quarries, and he felt in his bones that today was his day. Today he'd find something valuable enough to achieve his dream, and achieve it at the respectably early age of sixty-nine. His stock was selling for 183 credits a share, and all he needed was one more good find and GCI would owe him enough credits to enable him to buy a majority of himself. Even if his stock price rose, as was often the case with personal success, he could still make majority. He'd just have to pray that his personal valuation wouldn't go over 200 credits a share, and that he'd take home at least 20,000 credits from this venture. Yes, Omad was 100 shares away from controlling himself. He could taste it. The thought of being able to choose his own vacation times and consume what ever substance he wanted, when he wanted, almost made him too excited to work. But he quelled his feelings of joy and concentrated on the task at hand. <p></p><p></p>He was walking into a mine on GCI's property that hadn't been worked in centuries, and he was walking in without a corporation mine car or drill-bot. The less of GCI's equipment he used, the less of a percentage they'd be able to claim of his profits. It wasn't the norm, and he'd never have been as successful without corporate sponsorship and equipment, but this was different. Though it might take a little longer, this excavation would have to be done carefully and in person. Maximum allowable risk for maximum profit, and the risks were real. <p></p><p></p>Still, it was in these old mines that sometimes one got lucky. The technology of mineral extraction had improved greatly in the four centuries since this quarry had been actively worked. More important, the science of mineral transmutation had been born, and some metals were easier to transform from one into another. Many a decrepit lead mine had been reopened to turn its once worthless innards into a marketable commodity. And when this one was closed and forgotten in the late 1800s, it was done so out of prudence. It had been stripped bare, and there was simply no point in keeping it open any longer. What ever possible riches lay in waiting now, Omad was sure of one thing&#x2014;he would be the first to find them. <p></p><p></p>He took his time with the mine scan. Impatience might make him miss something, and even walls as old as these left hundreds of chemical and structural clues. Know before you go, he reminded himself. The first part of the morning was spent insuring that the caverns were sound. He need not have worried. The mountain was formed of igneous rock&#x2014;a type of hardened molten lava that had lasted eons and would last for eons more. By the time Omad finished his tests he was convinced the dig was stable. His safety assured, he now began looking for the telltale clues of wealth&#x2014;wealth that could be shared with his investors, his employers, and himself. If he was right about this place, all would benefit from the investment that individuals and society had made in him&#x2014;as it should be. Omad would also be pleased to gain 51 percent of himself, which was also as it should be. <p></p><p></p>His thoughts were interrupted and his dreams almost shattered by what appeared before him&#x2014;a tunnel shaft in abject disarray. It was blocked by a few large boulders among hundreds of smaller shards in all shapes and sizes. What had he missed? The sight of such instability alone almost made him turn back and choose a new mine. He had just conjectured that this one would last eons, and now here was proof that it was coming down a lot sooner than expected. Clearly a malfunction on the part of his hardware, he reasoned. Perhaps a costly one. But his years of experience told him what he already knew: The type of rock he'd ventured into didn't need a reader to give up its history&#x2014;only to verify it. He would exchange the mine-reader when he returned. But against his better judgment, or perhaps because of it, he decided to venture a little farther. <p></p><p></p>There was something here and he knew it. Plus, he was driven by his personal mantra, "Little risk, little profit," so he bent to examine the crumbled evidence before him. Explosives, he realized, upon examining the shards. Not a "natural" cave in after all. More evidence lay in Omad's path. What ever, or more precisely, whoever had made this mess had left the detonator, some primitive blasting caps, and humorously, an instruction manual on how to set off explosives in a mine. Since no skeleton or evidence of a body was visible, the perpetrator had obviously read the manual well, done the deed, and exited to safety. There was also a box of something called "Twinkies." Omad picked it up and examined it carefully. Aside from its unique and unusual artwork, he was able to discern its key ingredients as well as something called an "EXP" date, which was marked from an eleventh month in what appeared to be the early twenty-first century. This was starting to get interesting. He gathered all the wrappers and placed them in an airtight container, along with the manual and blasting caps he had so far collected. Omad loved a mystery, and judging from the leftover wrappers, whoever blasted this tunnel had time to eat at least twenty-eight of these Twinkie things and walk out in one piece. Must have been some kind of nutritional energy snack, he thought, as he cracked his knuckles and continued on deeper into the shaft. The dry, consistent atmosphere had preserved the scene almost as if the long-gone blaster had left just before Omad had arrived. Even if he couldn't make a profit out of what was buried in the tunnel, he might just make a profit from what he'd just discovered outside of it. The nutritional wrappers and blaster manual alone would fetch a very good price on the open relic market. No, even if he found nothing else, today would not be a loss by any stretch of the imagination. <p></p><p></p>Neela Harper was not a country girl. In fact, she'd always preferred the big city. Anything with only a million and a half people in it just didn't seem natural. If she had had any inkling that the career she had chosen for herself would dump her in this remote part of the world she probably wouldn't have chosen it. Then again, being a minority shareholder in herself, she would have had little or no say whatsoever about her place of employ. Luck of the draw, she thought somberly to herself. And this year I'm clearly down on my luck. Anybody looking at her would not be displeased. She was five feet eleven inches&#x2014;about average for a woman. A very healthy thirty-seven, but this was not surprising in the era of nano-medicine; positively everyone was healthy, and everyone looked great. Still, if everybody was a giant health-wise, then Neela, by her rigorous adherence to exercise, stood on the shoulders of those giants. Her appearance was 97 percent original, with only minor changes to control her hair growth and the removal of some facial bone damage suffered in a childhood accident. She hadn't had a sex change or so much as a boob job by her eighteenth birthday, something that was practically a rite of passage for her generation. Nope, just chestnut hair, green eyes, a tiny nose, freckles, and a supremely athletic body. Her problem was not so much physical as it was economic. <p></p><p></p>Not knowing what she wanted to do with her life, she spent all of high school and most of college studying t</p><h2>Astonishing Animals: Extraordinary Creatures and the Fantastic Worlds They Inhabit</h2><p>Sumptuous birds of paradise, amazing soft shell turtles, frogs that look like tomatoes, and terrifying fish (including the deep-water angler fish from Finding Nemo) are just some of the extraordinary creatures that can be found in Tim Flannery and Peter Schouten&#x2019;s new book Astonishing Animals.<br><br>Superbly illustrated in lifelike full color paintings, Astonishing Animals details ninety of the world&#x2019;s most amazing animals from around the world. In this book you will find the Hairy Seadevil, the spectacular Sulawesi Naked Bat, and in the depths of the limestone caves in Slovenia, the Olm, a pink, four-legged, sightless salamander that lives for a hundred years. In fascinating vignettes, Flannery offers the true evolutionary tale of how each of these bizarre creatures came to look the way they do. Alongside each historical account is a stunning hand painted color reproduction (life-size in the original painting) by Schouten.<br><br>Filled with purple-faced apes, jagged toothed dolphins, antlered lizards, Astonishing Animals is a remarkable collection of the world&#x2019;s most incredible creatures and the stories behind their remarkable survival into a modern age.<br></p><p>Tim Flannery is the director of the South Australian Museum in Adelaide.Flannery, a scientist, museum director and author (<i>The Eternal Frontier</i>), and Schouten, a Whitney award&#x2013;winning wildlife painter, team up again (after 2001's <i>A Gap in Nature</i>) to offer this spectacular look at 97 creatures who "represent, in one way or another, the outer limits of life's progress." (Actually, 96: one of these animals, they tease, is imaginary.) Some, like the deep sea&#x2013;dwelling hairy sea devil ("every bit as repulsive as its name suggests"), are products of their extreme environments; others, such as the blue bird of paradise, exhibit exceptional efforts at sexual attraction (the male bird dances while hanging upside-down from a branch, pulsing his feathers hypnotically and emitting "an intense, rhythmic buzzing"). Evolutionary pressures have made some very different creatures look remarkably alike, such as the long-beaked echidna (a mammal), the kiwi (a bird) and the mormyrid (a fish), which all feed on a similar diet of worms. There are beauties, such as the two-gram bee hummingbird; oddities, such as the white uakari, whose scarlet, very humanoid face earned it the nickname "the Englishman"; and grotesqueries, such as the Asian giant softshell turtle, which feeds on human corpses thrown into the Ganges River. All are rendered in masterful, full-color illustrations, some of which spill across two pages. Flannery's text is lively and informative, veering easily between droll descriptions and poignant warnings about disappearing habitats. As beautiful as it is fascinating, this book will be relished by animal lovers of all stripes. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

To become successful in their craft, teachers need to learn how to establish high-quality relationships with their students, and they need to learn how to implement instructional strategies that promote students' learning, development, and potential. To prepare pre-service teachers for the profession, the study of educational psychology can help them to better understand their students and better understand their process of teaching. Such is the twofold purpose of <i>Educational Psychology</i> &#x2013; to help pre-service teachers understand their future students better and to help them understand all aspects of the teaching-learning situation. The pursuit of these two purposes leads to the ultimate goal of this text &#x2013; namely, to help pre-service teachers become increasingly able to promote student learning, development, and potential when it becomes their turn to step into the classroom and take full-time responsibility for their own classes.</p><p><b>Make Reflection an Everyday Practice<br> </b>Because today's classrooms and instructional demands are changing, new teachers need to be able to frame questions about their classrooms, use theories and research to think critically about the answers to those questions, and then take action. <p></p> Using real classroom cases, thought-provoking questions, and synthesizing activities, the authors guide students through a unique 4-step process&#x2013;&#x2013;Reflection, Information Gathering, Decision-Making, and&nbsp;Evaluation (RIDE)&#x2013;&#x2013;that seamlessly translates theory into practice, and helps make reflection an everyday practice. <p></p> Written by experts in cognition, motivation, and assessment, <i>Educational Psychology: Reflection for Action</i> provides an effective framework that not only makes the study of educational psychology manageable, but also develops new teachers into reflective practitioners. <p></p> <b>About the Authors<br> </b><b>Angela M.

Gauri Viswanathan skillfully argues that conversion is an interpretive act that belongs in the realm of cultural criticism. To that end, this work examines key moments in colonial and postcolonial history to show how conversion questions the limitations of secular ideologies, particularly the discourse of rights central to both the British empire and the British nation-state. Implicit in such questioning is an attempt to construct an alternative epistemological and ethical foundation of national community. Viswanathan grounds her study in an examination of two simultaneous and, she asserts, linked events: the legal emancipation of religious minorities in England and the acculturation of colonial subjects to British rule. The author views these two apparently disparate events as part of a common pattern of national consolidation that produced the English state. She seeks to explain why resistance, in both cases, frequently took the form of religious conversion, especially to "minority" or alternative religions. Confronting the general characterization of conversion as assimilative and annihilating of identity, Viswanathan demonstrates that a willful change of religion can be seen instead as an act of opposition. <i>Outside the Fold</i> concludes that, as a form of cultural crossing, conversion comes to represent a vital release into difference.</p><p>Through the figure of the convert, Viswanathan addresses the vexing question of the role of belief and minority discourse in modern society. She establishes new points of contact between the convert as religious dissenter and as colonial subject. This convergence provides a transcultural perspective not otherwise visible in literary and historical texts. It allows for radically new readings of significant figures as diverse as John Henry Newman, Pandita Ramabai, Annie Besant, and B. R. Ambedkar, as well as close studies of court cases, census reports, and popular English fiction. These varying texts illuminate the means by which discourses of religious identity are produced, contained, or opposed by the languages of law, reason, and classificatory knowledge. <i>Outside the Fold</i> is a challenging, provocative contribution to the multidisciplinary field of cultural studies.</p></p><p><p>"I cannot conceive of a more important reading in its detail and its strength.

Living with her overbearing mother and meddlesome aunt, she found her only consolations in the &#34;forbidden&#34; books of John Foster and her daydreams of the Blue Castle. Then a letter arrived from Dr. Trent -- and Valancy decided to throw caution to the winds. For the first time in her life Valancy did and said exactly what she wanted. Soon she discovered a surprising new world, full of love and adventures far beyond her most secret dreams.Lucy Maud Montgomery CBE, (always called "Maud" by family and friends) and publicly known as L. M. Montgomery, (November 30, 1874&#x2013;April 24, 1942) was a Canadian author, best known for a series of novels beginning with Anne of Green Gables, published in 1908. Once published, Anne of Green Gables was an immediate success. The central character, Anne, an orphaned girl, made Montgomery famous in her lifetime and gave her an international following. The first novel was followed by a series of sequels with Anne as the central character. The novels became the basis for the highly acclaimed 1985 CBC television miniseries, Anne of Green Gables and several other television movies and programs, including Road to Avonlea, which ran in Canada and the U.S. from 1990-1996.</p><h2>The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket (Modern Library Classics)</h2><p>After reading an 1836 newspaper account of a shipwreck and its two survivors, Edgar Allan Poe penned his only novel, <i>The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket</i>, the story of a stowaway on a Nantucket whaleship who finds himself enmeshed in the dark side of life at sea: mutiny, cannibalism, savagery&#x2014;even death. As Jeffrey Meyers writes in his Introduction: &#x201c;[Poe] remains contemporary because he appeals to basic human feelings and expresses universal themes common to all men in all languages: dreams, love, loss; grief, mourning, alienation; terror, revenge, murder; insanity, disease, and death.&#x201d; Within the pages of this novel, we encounter nearly all of them.<br><br>This Modern Library Paperback Classic reprints the text of the original 1838 American edition.</p><p>&#x201c;It is Poe&#x2019;s greatest work.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Jorge Luis Borges</b><b>Jeffrey Meyers</b>, a distinguished biographer, is the author of <i>Edgar Allan Poe, D.

But one of the congenial meals is interrupted by a neighbor who has stumbled across the body of a young man in the nearby Rue Popincourt. Maigret answers the call with his friend Dr. Pardon, and their pleasant evening is quickly brought to an end by the commencement of a complicated murder case. And when a tape recorder is discovered on the victim's body, it only complicates matters.<br><br>Maigret's investigation leads to the discovery of another crime altogether and the fascinating story of the murdered man's life. <i>Maigret and the Killer</i> is a taut, engrossing mystery that shows off Georges Simenon's flair for creating complex characters with deeply human problems and his ability to make a senseless crime understandable.</p><p><b>Georges Simenon</b> (1903-1989) was born in Li�ge, Belgium. He is best known in the English-speaking world as the author of the Inspector Maigret books. His prolific output of more than four hundred novels and short stories has made him a household name in continental Europe.<b>Praise for Georges Simenon:</b><br><br>&#x201c;One of the greatest writers of the twentieth century&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Nevertheless, as the increasingly exquisite and detailed financial data demonstrate, financial markets often fail to behave as they should if trading were truly dominated by the fully rational investors that populate financial theories. These markets anomalies have spawned a new approach to finance, one which as editor Richard Thaler puts it, "entertains the possibility that some agents in the economy behave less than fully rationally some of the time." Advances in Behavioral Finance collects together twenty-one recent articles that illustrate the power of this approach. These papers demonstrate how specific departures from fully rational decision making by individual market agents can provide explanations of otherwise puzzling market phenomena. To take several examples, Werner De Bondt and Thaler find an explanation for superior price performance of firms with poor recent earnings histories in the tendencies of investors to overreact to recent information. Richard Roll traces the negative effects of corporate takeovers on the stock prices of the acquiring firms to the overconfidence of managers, who fail to recognize the contributions of chance to their past successes. Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny show how the difficulty of establishing a reliable reputation for correctly assessing the value of long term capital projects can lead investment analysis, and hence corporate managers, to focus myopically on short term returns. As a testing ground for assessing the empirical accuracy of behavioral theories, the successful studies in this landmark collection reach beyond the world of finance to suggest, very powerfully, the importance of pursuing behavioral approaches to other areas of economic life. Advances in Behavioral Finance is a solid beachhead for behavioral work in the financial arena and a clear promise of wider application for behavioral economics in the future.</p></p><p>RICHARD H.

It is natural because, as a leader, you want to set the pace even as you demonstrate that nothing is beneath you. It is necessary because most of the time nobody is around to help. But what may initially be natural and necessary will ultimately limit your effectiveness.<br> Perhaps the two best-kept secrets of leadership are these:<br> &nbsp;<br> 1. &nbsp;The less you do, the more you accomplish.<br> &nbsp;<br> 2. &nbsp;The less you do, the more you enable others to accomplish.<br> &nbsp;<br> As a young leader, my biggest mistake was allowing my time to be eaten up with things outside my core competen- cies. I devoted an inordinate amount of my first seven years in ministry to things I was not good at&#x2014;things I would <i>never </i>be good at. At the same time, I invested little energy in developing my strengths.<br> I am a good communicator. I am not a good manager.<br> &nbsp;<br>I am a good visioncaster. I am not good at follow-up. I know how to prepare a message. I am not good at planning an event.<br> And yet early on I did nothing to hone my communica- tion skills. Instead, I spent a great deal of time trying to become a better manager and a better event planner. When it came to communication, I would often wing it because the time I should have used to prepare talks had been con- sumed by other things. And this was the one area in which I <i>could </i>wing it.<br> The problem was that somewhere along the way I had bought into the myth that a good leader has to be good at everything. So I operated under the assumption that I had to upgrade my weaknesses into strengths. After all, who would follow a leader who wasn&#x2019;t well-rounded?<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b><i>After &nbsp;graduate school </i></b>I went to work for my dad. As a minister to students my primary responsibilities revolved around developing a strategy for involving junior high and high school students in the life of the church.<br> The fact that this was my first job opportunity after grad school, combined with the reality that I was working for my dad, sent me into the workforce determined to succeed. I felt the need to prove myself by working harder than every- one else around me. I came in early and went home late. I was in constant motion.<br> But I did not work smart. The majority of my time was devoted to tasks I was not good at. I was eight years into my career before I realized that my real value to our organiza- tion lay within the context of my giftedness, not the number of hours I worked.<br> From that point forward I began looking for ways to&nbsp;redefine my job description according to what I was good at, rather than simply what I was willing to do. I discovered that there were some balls I had no business juggling. When I finally mustered the courage to let &#x2019;em fall to the floor and roll over in the corner, I began to excel in juggling the two or three balls I was created to keep in the air in the first place.<br> My success attracted others who were committed to the same cause. While we shared the same passion for students, our skill-sets were different. It wasn&#x2019;t long before they began picking up the stray balls I had let fall. The responsibilities I was reluctant to relinquish turned out to be opportunities for others. The very activities that drained me fueled other team members.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b><i>Consequently, I began </i></b>to do more communicating and less event planning. I learned how to spend the majority of my time at the thirty-thousand-foot level while remaining accessible to team members who were closer to the action. I spent more time strategizing and less time problem solving. I became far more proactive about what I allowed on my calendar. I became more mission-driven rather than need- driven, and now I want to give you that same vision as it relates to your core competencies:<br> &nbsp;<br> <b><i>ONLY DO WHAT &nbsp;ONLY YOU CAN DO.</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> This might seem unrealistic from where you sit today. You might even laugh out loud. But once you get past the seeming improbability of this axiom, write it down and work toward it.<br> What are the two or three things that you and only you are responsible for? What, specifically, have you been hired to do? What is &#x201c;success&#x201d; for the person in your position?<br><br>Now let&#x2019;s slice it even thinner. Of the two or three things that define success for you, which of those are in line with your giftedness? Of the tasks you have been assigned to do, which of them are you specifically gifted to do?<br> That is where you must focus your energies. That is your sweet spot. That is where you will excel. Within that narrowed context you will add the most value to your organi- zation. Success within that sphere has the potential to make you indispensable to your employer.<br> Best of all, you will enjoy what you do.<br> &#x201c;Impossible!&#x201d; you say. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t afford to focus my ener- gies on only a percentage of my overall responsibilities!&#x201d;<br> Maybe not yet. But you owe it to yourself to identify the areas in which you have the highest probability for success. You owe it to your employer to identify the areas in which you could add the most value to your organization. You can&#x2019;t aim for a target until you have identified it. We&#x2019;re talk- ing about a mind-set here, a perspective, a way of thinking. This is a vision. This is something you must work toward to maximize your potential as a leader.<br> During the 2001 baseball season, Greg Maddux of the Atlanta Braves had a batting average of .253&#x2014;average by professional standards. Yet he is one of the most highly sought-after players in the National Baseball League. Why? Because in his role as pitcher, he struck out 173 batters the previous year. His skill with a bat is not what makes him an indispensable part of the lineup. His ninety-mile-an-hour fastball does.<br> Should he spend more time working on his hitting? Maybe&#x2014;but certainly not at the expense of his pitching.<br>&nbsp;<br> Identify the areas in which you are most likely to add unique value to your organization&#x2014;some- thing no one else can match&#x2014;then &nbsp;leverage your skills to their absolute max. That&#x2019;s &nbsp;what your employer expected when he put you on the payroll! More importantly, leveraging yourself generates the greatest and most satisfying return on your God-given abilities.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b><i>The &nbsp;moment &nbsp;a &nbsp;leader </i></b>steps away from his core compe- tencies, his effectiveness as a leader diminishes. Worse, the effectiveness of every other leader in the organization suffers too. In time, a leader who is not leading from the right &#x201c;zone&#x201d; will create an unfavorable environment for other leaders.<br> Let me explain. Using John Maxwell&#x2019;s one-to-ten leadership scale, score yourself as a leader1. If you are an exceptional leader, give yourself an eight or a nine. If you consider yourself an average leader, give yourself a five or a six. For the sake of illustration, let&#x2019;s say that when you&#x2019;re at the top of your game you are a seven.<br> Maxwell argues that at a seven, you will attract followers who are fives and sixes. If you were a nine, you would attract sevens and eights. In other words, leaders attract other lead- ers whose skills come close to matching but rarely surpass their own.<br> Perhaps you&#x2019;ve known the frustration of working for some- one whose leadership skills were inferior to yours. It probably wasn&#x2019;t long before you were looking for another place to work. On the other hand, you might know the thrill of working for leaders whose leadership skills were superior to yours.<br><br>Such environments probably brought out the best in you.<br> Now, back to my point. Assuming you are a seven, you will be at your best when you are in your zone&#x2014;that is, when you are devoting your time to the things you are naturally gifted to do. That&#x2019;s when you operate as a seven. And as a seven, you will attract fives and sixes. And, if you are secure, other sevens.<br> Furthermore, you may have seven potential, but outside your core competencies you will lead like a six. If you con- tinue in that mode, you will lose the devotion and possibly the respect of the other sixes around you. In time, you will dumb down the leadership level of your entire organiza- tion&#x2014;everybody suffers.<br> Like most good principles, this one is somewhat intuitive. It makes sense. Yet many a leader has leaned his shoulder into the wind and forged ahead, determined to do it all and do it all well. In fact, you may get into a head-versus-heart battle of your own as you reflect on the implications of this idea. No doubt your heart leaps with excitement at the thought of con- centrating on the areas in which yo u naturally&nbsp; excel. Intuitively you know that&#x2019;s the way to go. But your head says, &#x201c;Wait a minute&#x2014;it can&#x2019;t be that simple!&#x201d;<br> After challenging hundreds of leaders to play to their strengths, I have identified five primary obstacles to a leader adopting this way of thinking.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b><i>1. &nbsp;THE QUEST FOR BALANCE</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> The first thing that sometimes keeps next generation leaders from playing to their strengths is that the idea of being a balanced or well-rounded leader looks good on paper and sounds compelling coming from behind a lectern, but in reality, it is an unworthy endeavor. Read the biographies of&nbsp;the achievers in any arena of life. You will find over and over that these were not &#x201c;well-rounded&#x201d; leaders. They were men and women of <i>focus.</i><br> We should strive for balance organizationally, but it is not realistic to strive for balance within the sphere of our per- sonal leadership abilities. Striving for balance forces a leader to invest time and energy in aspects of leadership where he will never excel. When the point person in an organization strives for balance, he potentially robs other leaders of an opportunity to perform at the top of their game.<br> My current context for leadership is the local church. Like most churches, ours has a component that focuses exclusively on high school students. The person who tackles that responsibility is usually someone who excels in leading people from the platform. Student pastors are often animated, pied-piper individuals.<br> The fellow who leads that charge at North Point is not. Kevin Ragsdale is a great example of a singularly focused, highly effective leader. Yet Kevin&#x2019;s strength is administra- tion. By his own admission, Kevin is not a great platform personality. Rather than waste his time trying to become proficient in an area where he may never excel, Kevin has trained and mentored a group of individuals who are gifted communicators and visioncasters.<br> In other words, Kevin is not well-rounded in his leader- ship ability, but his organization is well-rounded. He focuses on what he is gifted in and empowers others t...</p><h2>Western Civilizations: Their History &amp; Their Culture (Eighteenth Edition) (Vol. 1)</h2><p><p><strong>A storytelling approach that engages students with features to help them master core content, think critically, and make connections.</strong></p> The engaging narrative and carefully crafted, innovative pedagogical tools in <em>Western Civilizations</em> are based on the co-authors&#x2019; own teaching experiences.

He responded to and expanded upon Immanuel Kant&#x2019;s philosophy concerning the way in which we experience the world. His critique of Kant, his creative solutions to the problems of human experience and his explication of the limits of human knowledge are among his most important achievements. His metaphysical theory is the foundation of his influential writings on psychology, aesthetics, ethics, and politics which influenced Friedrich Nietzsche, Wagner, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Sigmund Freud and others. He said he was influenced by the Upanishads, Immanuel Kant, and Plato. References to Eastern philosophy and religion appear frequently in his writing. He appreciated the teachings of the Buddha and even called himself a Buddhaist. He said that his philosophy could not have been conceived before these teachings were available. He called himself a Kantian. He formulated a pessimistic philosophy that gained importance and support after the failure of the German and Austrian revolutions of 1848.</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes: The Giant Rat of Sumatra</h2><p>In deference to Sherlock Holmes&#x2019;s wishes, Dr Watson kept the tale of The Giant Rat of Sumatra a secret.

At every turning, you come upon some shiny pearl of information."&#x2014;<i>The Economist</i><br><br>In this broad-thinking and profound piece of history, Robert William Fogel synthesizes an amazing range of data into a bold and intriguing view of America's past and future&#x2014;one in which the periodic Great Awakenings of religion bring about waves of social reform, the material lives of even the poorest Americans improve steadily, and the nation now stands poised for a renewed burst of egalitarian progress.</p><p>Winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize for Economics, <b>Robert William Fogel</b>, is the Charles R. Walgreen Distinguished Service Professor of American Institutions in the Graduate School of Business, director of the Center for Population Economics, and a member of the Department of Economics and of the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago. He is also coauthor of the bestselling <i>Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery</i>.Nobel Prize-winning University of Chicago economist Fogel (Without Consent or Contract: The Rise and Fall of American Slavery) ambitiously tries to integrate the history of American religion with the history of social reform and the move toward equality. Fogel says that 18th- and 19th-century America experienced three large religious revivals--or Great Awakenings--each bringing about social reforms. The first awakening began in 1730 and laid the groundwork for the American Revolution. The second began in 1800, and inspired abolitionists and temperance workers. The mandate of the third awakening, which began in 1890, was the welfare state, which culminated in the 1930s. And we are now, Fogel suggests, in the middle of a fourth awakening, which began in 1950. Fogel argues that the egalitarian platforms of the third awakening have been more or less implemented--the condition of the poorest families in America, he suggests, has improved dramatically; the labor reforms that Social Gospelers called for have been written into law; many people have access to decent health care. In order to make America even more egalitarian, says Fogel, we will need a new agenda. Leaders in the fourth great awakening, he suggests, have emphasized spiritual, rather than material, equity--they are interested in redistributing "spiritual resources" and in helping Americans of all ranks become self-actualized (he identifies spiritual assets as "a sense of purpose, self-esteem, a sense of discipline, a thirst for knowledge"). Fogel applauds the democratizing of self-realization, and he emphasizes the need to provide an education for all; he is especially keen to see more Americans pursuing higher education. Fogel's thesis is provocative, though some readers may question his emphasis on higher education, which he seems to suggest would be a panacea for all America's ills.

In this beautifully illustrated, practical handbook, Heidi Gildemeister provides both novice and experienced gardeners with a comprehensive guide for waterwise gardening, with over one thousand drought-tolerant Mediterranean plants chosen both for their beauty and for their easygoing ways. Well indexed with common and botanical names, <i>Mediterranean Gardening </i>will be indispensable not only for gardeners in California, the Mediterranean basin, and Mediterranean climate areas in South America, Australia, and Africa, but for anyone living in a region that experiences drought.<br><br>Gildemeister explains how drought-tolerant plants that are suitably matched with a site and carefully planted and mulched can live on winter rain and, once established, do not need additional summer water&#x2014;as in nature. The Plant Selection lists over one thousand plants from nearly five hundred genera, including their preferred growing conditions, propagation, best use, and maintenance. Guidelines in eight steps describe the planning of waterwise gardens, such as for the establishment of dappled shade to conserve precious soil moisture. Successful alternatives to the water-intensive lawn offer attractive design ideas.<br><br><i>Mediterranean Gardening </i>offers a wealth of information: "easy" plants for the beginner, new choices for the garden architect, and for botanists the latest findings on minimum temperatures plants can endure. An extensive bibliography covering drought tolerance and a list of useful addresses make this book as helpful to people converting to water-, labor-, and ecology-conscious gardening as to those starting from scratch.</p><p><b>Heidi Gildemeister</b> converted a maquis-covered western Mediterranean landscape into a thriving ten-acre garden and became a pioneer of waterwise gardening in the Mediterranean region.

She lectures worldwide and has contributed to <i>The Royal Horticultural Society Dictionary of Gardening. </i>She is a member of the Botanical Society of South Africa, the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, and the International Dendrology Society and is a founding member and former president of the Mediterranean Garden Society.&#34;This is no ordinary book on drought-tolerant plants, but the accumulated wisdom of twenty years spent learning about the Mediterranean climate, and its plants and soils. The learning was not the casual process of one warned by municipal authorities that water is becoming scarce, but the urgent seeking for knowledge of an intelligent gardener entirely dependent on rainfall. . . . The pictures, too, are delightfully different from those we have come to expect in books on waterwise gardening.&#34;--&#34;Pacific Horticulture&#34;</p><h2>The Original Frankenstein (Vintage Classics)</h2><p>Working from the earliest surviving draft of <b>Frankenstein</b>, Charles E. Robinson presents two versions of the classic novel&#x2014;as Mary Shelley originally wrote it and a subsequent version clearly indicating Percy Shelley&#x2019;s amendments and contributions.<br><br> For the first time we can hear Mary&#x2019;s sole voice, which is colloquial, fast-paced, and sounds more modern to a contemporary reader. We can also see for the first time the extent of Percy Shelley&#x2019;s contribution&#x2014;some 5,000 words out of 72,000&#x2014;and his stylistic and thematic changes. His occasionally florid prose is in marked contrast to the directness of Mary&#x2019;s writing. Interesting, too, are Percy&#x2019;s suggestions, which humanize the monster, thus shaping many of the major themes of the novel as we read it today. In these two versions of <b>Frankenstein</b> we have an exciting new view of one of literature&#x2019; s greatest works.</p><p><i>Frankenstein,</i> loved by many decades of readers and praised by such eminent literary critics as Harold Bloom, seems hardly to need a recommendation. If you haven't read it recently, though, you may not remember the sweeping force of the prose, the grotesque, surreal imagery, and the multilayered <i>doppelg�nger</i> themes of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. As fantasy writer Jane Yolen writes of this (the reviewer's favorite) edition, "The strong black and whites of the main text [illustrations] are dark and brooding, with unremitting shadows and stark contrasts. But the central conversation with the monster--who owes nothing to the overused movie image ... but is rather the novel's charnel-house composite--is where [Barry] Moser's illustrations show their greatest power ... The viewer can all but smell the powerful stench of the monster's breath as its words spill out across the page. Strong book-making for one of the world's strongest and most remarkable books."

"He wrote for the day, the moment; but these are just the writers whom posterity is apt to put into its pocket." Considered by contemporary critics to be Trollope's greatest novel, The Way We Live Now is a satire of the literary world of London in the 1870s and a bold indictment of the new power of speculative finance in English life. "I was instigated by what I conceived to be the commercial profligacy of the age," Trollope said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; His story concerns Augustus Melmotte, a French swindler and scoundrel, and his daughter, to whom Felix Carbury, adored son of the authoress Lady Carbury, is induced to propose marriage for the sake of securing a fortune. Trollope knew well the difficulties of dealing with editors, publishers, reviewers, and the public; his portrait of Lady Carbury, impetuous, unprincipled, and unswervingly devoted to her own self-promotion, is one of his finest satirical achievements.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; His picture of late nineteenth century England is of a society on the verge of moral bankruptcy, where the traditional virtues of Tory squirearchy, represented by Roger Carbury, prove to be no match for the financial genius of Augustus Melmotte. In The Way We Live Now Trollope combines his talents as a portraitist and his skills as a storyteller to give us life as it was lived more than a hundred years ago.</p><h2>Semiotext[e] SF</h2><p>A massive outsider sci-fi anthology.

Original.</p><p>PETE DUNNE is the author of eleven books, including Pete Dunne&#x2019;s Essential Field Guide Companion and Pete Dunne on Bird Watching. He is the vice president of the New Jersey Audubon Society and director of its Cape May Bird Observatory.Introduction<br><br>Every Monday, 7:30 A.M., South Cape May<br>The parking lot had ten cars in it&#x2014;about average for a Monday in early July. <br>Come September, when bird migration runs full bore and birders are <br>packing Cape May motels, the lot is full.<br> I parked in a spot that promised shade. Reached for the <br>binoculars that live under the driver"s seat. Extracted myself from the car, <br>exhumed my spotting scope from the trunk, then paused, filtering the world <br>through senses refined by more than forty years of birding.<br> The silhouette on the utility line belonged to the local <br>mockingbird. My ears told me he was running through his standard repertoire <br>(which even by mockingbird standards was considerable).<br> Audio reconnaissance also detected the spiraling yodel of a <br>descending yellowlegs, a migrating shorebird, and the silver-toned call <br>notes of Bobolinks migrating high overhead.<br> All the signs suggested a good day"s birding, maybe even a great <br>day"s birding. Every morning I wake up carries this potential.<br> "Good morning," I said to the semicircle of faces. "I"m director of <br>New Jersey Audubon Society"s Cape May Bird Observatory. You have very <br>cleverly positioned yourself at the crossroads of migration at the junction of <br>three seasons."<br> I paused, allowing time for this disclosure to sink in. When most <br>people think of bird migration, they focus upon the peak congestion periods <br>in the spring and fall. The fact is that over much of North America birds are <br>shifting constantly&#x2014;from north to south, south to north, interior to coast, <br>higher elevation to lower; from places with exhausted resources to places <br>offering birds greater opportunity.<br> What this means for people who watch birds is that every trip <br>afield is a treasure hunt with endless possibilities. Making the most of <br>these opportunities is a matter of getting the right equipment, putting yourself <br>in fortune"s path, and learning how and where to look.<br> Topics which are, not coincidentally, central to this book.<br> Assisting me on my morning walk were two of Cape May Bird <br>Observatory"s associate naturalists. Tom Parsons, a retired professor of <br>vertebrate biology, has been a birder all his life. Bill Glaser, a former <br>engraver, took up birding after retirement. Together they make a wonderfully <br>balanced team and a good point: shared interest, not experience, is the <br>common denominator in birding. It truly doesn"t matter if you started birding <br>yesterday, last year, or before field guides were invented. All birders, no <br>matter what their skill level, are drawn to the same thing: the excitement, the <br>challenge, and the pleasure that comes from watching birds. And all birders <br>are eager to share their knowledge with others, an ethic that is fundamental <br>to field trips and, as you will discover, this book.<br> I resumed my litany, explaining to regulars and newcomers alike <br>what we were about to do, how long we would be about it, and what special <br>birds of the season we were likely to encounter. As I spoke, I tried to gauge <br>the skill levels of my listeners, to discern who might need extra attention or <br>guidance. It seemed a pretty eclectic group.<br> Several individuals armed with high-quality, well-used binoculars <br>were evidently serious birders who knew Cape May"s fame and had <br>probably come with a shopping list of species they hoped to see.<br> Most of the members of the group, however, looked more casually <br>interested in birds. Several were carrying bird guides that might have been <br>useful for back-yard bird watching but whose deficiencies made them more <br>hindrance than help in the field. Even people who are casual about birding <br>shouldn"t be frustrated by it. I made a mental note to engage them during <br>the walk and recommend a more field-worthy guide.<br> Far too many individuals were armed with binoculars that wouldn"t <br>pass muster&#x2014;gimmick-ridden instruments that were too large, too small, or <br>too poorly designed to be useful in the birding arena. We"d replace these <br>with instruments from our arsenal of well-chosen loaners.<br> There were also a number of people, including a family of four, <br>who were clearly beginners. The birds, the names, the skills, the etiquette, <br>the very process of seeing a bird critically, noting distinguishing <br>characteristics, and finding its likeness in a book, would be new to them.<br> This process, which binds a bird with its name, is replicated in <br>this book. While the information in this book is intended to serve birders of <br>all interests and skill levels, it has been organized to follow the developmental <br>stages that birders go through as their interest develops and their horizons <br>expand.<br> Must you read this book just to go out and look at birds? No. You <br>can do what I did at the age of seven. Grab binoculars. Run out the back <br>door. Start peering into the trees.<br> But you will discover (if you have not already) that there is a vast <br>difference between looking for birds and finding them. While looking is fun, <br>finding is more fun. And being able to identify what you find is the most fun <br>of all. If forty years ago I had had this book, I would have found a good many <br>more birds, been frustrated a good deal less, and been a better birder for it <br>today.<br> I also would have devoured this book. Because it answers many <br>of the questions I faced in my early efforts to become a better field birder&#x2014;<br>the same questions birders face today.<br> "Any questions?" I asked the group.<br> There were none, yet, but over the course of the next two hours <br>there would be many.<br> The mockingbird (who had never stopping singing) offered a more <br>than passable rendition of a flicker"s call . . . then Killdeer . . . then a <br>Carolina Wren. . . . Out of a cotton and cobalt sky the piped whistle of a high-<br>flying Osprey drifted to earth, and beyond the dunes a string of Brown <br>Pelicans lofted into momentary view, then disappeared.<br> It sure was shaping up to be a good day. Maybe even a great one.<br> "Okay," I said, "let"s go birding."<br> &#x2014;September 2002<br><br>Copyright � 2003 by Pete Dunne.

The Black Death is sweeping through Europe. In Florence, plague has carried off one hundred thousand people. In their Tuscan villas, seven young women and three young men tell tales to recreate the world they have lost, weaving a rich tapestry of comedy, tragedy, ribaldry and farce. Boccaccio&#39;s Decameron recasts the storytelling heritage of the ancient and medieval worlds into perennial forms that inspired writers from Chaucer and Shakespeare down to our own day. Boccaccio makes the incredible believable, with detail so sharp we can look straight into the lives of people who lived six hundred years ago. His Decameron hovers between the fading glories of an aristocratic past - the Crusades, the Angevins, the courts of France, the legendary East - and the colourful squalor of contemporary life, where wives deceive husbands, friars and monks pursue fleshly ends, and natural instincts fight for satisfaction. Here are love and jealousy, passion and pride - and a shrewd calculation of profit and loss which heralds the rise of a dynamic merchant class. These stories show us early capitalism during a moment of crisis and revelation.</p><p>Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-1375) is one of the most famous authors in Italian literature. An important Renaissance humanist, his works include On Famous Women, The Decameron and his poetry in the vernacular.This fourteenth-century Italian book, which inspired Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Balzac, remains one of the most enjoyable anthologies of short stories ever written. Some young unmarried nobles, the "beautiful people" of the age, decide to wait out the Florentine plague in their country estates, amusing each other every evening with earthy stories, some outright bawdy, others pointing to a moral. Nine capable Brits represent the storytellers in Naxos's sampling of a graceful, uncredited translation. Well-chosen music adds to the atmosphere.

The vivid poetry of Sappho survived antiquity on remnants of damaged papyrus, riddled with gaps. The inscription on a beautiful fourth century B.C.E. grave praises the virtues of Mnesarete, an Athenian woman who died young, but we do not know if the grave's marble stele shows Mnesarete, or simply a ready-made design chosen by her family. We read that on one occasion in the fourth century a great number of Roman wives were given a collective public trial and found guilty of poisoning their husbands, but we can only guess whether these "poisonings" were linked to a high occurrence of accidental food poisoning, or disease, or something more sinister. Apart from the legends of Cleopatra, Dido and Lucretia, and images of graceful maidens dancing on urns, the evidence about the lives of women of the classical world--visual, archaeological, and written----has remained uncollected and uninterpreted.<br> <br> Now, the lavishly illustrated and meticulously researched <em>Women in the Classical World</em> lifts the curtain on the women of ancient Greece and Rome, from slaves and prostitutes, to Athenian housewives, to Rome's imperial family. The first book on classical women to give equal weight to written texts and artistic representations, it brings together a great wealth of materials--poetry, vase painting, legislation, medical treatises, architecture, religious and funerary art, women's ornaments, historical epics, political speeches, even ancient coins--to present women in the historical and cultural context of their time. Written by leading experts in the fields of ancient history and art history, women's studies, and Greek and Roman literature, the book's chronological arrangement allows the changing roles of women to unfold over a thousand year period, beginning in the eighth century B.C.E. The authors seek out literature that preserves women's own voices. Both the art and the literature highlight women's creativity, sexuality and coming of age, marriage and childrearing, religious and public roles, and other themes. Fascinating chapters probe revealing aspects of the classical world: the ubiquitous reports of wild behavior on the part of Spartan and Etruscan women and the mythical Amazons; the changing views of the female body presented in male-authored gynecological treatises; the "new woman" represented by the love poetry of the late Republic and Augustan Age; and the traces of upper and lower-class life in Pompeii, miraculously preserved by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 C.E.<br> <br> Provocative, surprising, filled with timeless examples of the rich legacy of classical art, <em>Women in the Classical World</em> is a masterly foray into the past, and a definitive statement on the lives of women in ancient Greece and Rome.</p><p><br><em>About the Authors:</em><br> <br> <strong>Elaine Fantham</strong> is Giger Professor of Latin at Princeton University. <strong>Helene Peet Foley</strong> is Olin Professor of Classics at Barnard College. <strong>Natalie Boymel Kampen</strong> is Professor of Women's Studies and Art History at Barnard College. <strong>Sarah B. Pomeroy</strong> is Professor of History at Columbia University. <strong>H. Alan</strong> <strong>Shapiro</strong> is Professor of Classics at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand.<br>It's no easy task to assemble accurate portraits of the women of ancient Greece and Rome. Fantham and her collaborators--all professors of classics, history, art history, or Latin--have conducted diligent searches of surviving sources, both literary and visual, to chronicle the lives of women both famous and anonymous, aristocratic and indentured, worshiped and abused. The result is a unique illustrated chronological survey of women's lives built upon a foundation of vivid cultural and social history and laced with poetry, anecdotes, and original interpretations. Women are portrayed within the contexts of household customs, sexual mores, experiences in marriage, outlets for creativity, religion, motherhood, and politics. Each sphere is illuminated in surprising detail, the result of careful yet passionate study of all kinds of texts, from medical treatises to trade documents and literature, as well as by astute scrutiny of images found on monuments, decorative arts, murals, and sculptures. Fantham and company have achieved an exciting and invaluable synthesis of visual and literary materials, a triumph, in sum, of scholarship and analysis. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>China: A New History</h2><p><p> There is a newer edition of this book. </p></p><p><b>John King Fairbank</b> was Francis Lee Higginson Professor of History and Director of the East Asian Research Center at Harvard University.No American scholar of China was better known to the public and academia alike than Fairbank.

In covering the breadth of the country's history, from the earliest archaeological records to the present, the author is occasionally short on details, but lay readers and undergraduate students will appreciate the perceptive analysis and explanation throughout, leading to a better understanding of this complex nation, its people, and its importance in the world. Furthermore, Fairbank's command of recent research, along with an excellent bibliography, will appeal to the scholarly audience. Highly recommended. History Book Club selection.<br><i>- Kenneth W.

White, Jr., formerly Curator of Transportation at the Smithsonian Institution, has written eight books and more than one hundred articles on American railroad technology.</p>White, a historian emeritus at the Smithsonian Institution, has written the definitive work on the American railroad freight car, at least up to 1910. This massive work (32 cm. high) is a companion piece to the author's The American Railroad Passenger Car ( LJ 6/1/78), and it is done with the same care and thoroughness. The book is primarily technical in nature, with many drawings and details of construction. As such, it is an excellent reference work, of invaluable help to historians, railroad enthusiasts, and model railroad hobbyists. However, the author also includes excellent chapters on the economics of freight cars and railroads in the 19th century. Locating the data for this book was difficult; few primary sources were available, and journals provided much of the data. The photographs give good illustrations of the freight cars and the times. This is essential for historical, railroad, engineering, and hobby collections.<br><i>- George M.

It can create an ethic of care and justice that makes schools safer and happier, not only through reducing conflict, but also in terms of developing active citizenship skills, good self-esteem, open communication and team work in students.</p><p>From a teaching background herself, Belinda Hopkins is at the forefront of the development of restorative justice in the UK, and in this practical handbook she presents a whole school approach to repairing harm using a variety of means including peer mediation, healing circles and conference circles. She provides clear, practical guidance for group sessions and examines issues and ideas relating to practical skill development for facilitators.</p><p>Clearly structured and with photocopiable sheets, this book is an excellent resource for teachers, school counsellors and youth workers seeking a more positive and effective way to deal with conflict in educational settings.</p></p><p>Belinda Hopkins is Director and Lead Trainer of Transforming Conflict, a centre for restorative justice in education.In this practical handbook, Belinda Hopkins demonstrates how the principles and values of restorative justice can help transform daily interactions in schools. She makes a strong case for focusing on building and repairing relationships rather than on managing and controlling behaviour. The book is written with the needs of teachers and youth workers in mind. It is clearly structured and presented, with user-friendly diagrams and photocopiable sheets. Case studies provide plenty of good examples from the author's own experience. While Hopkins clearly understands the practical demands of school organisation, she nevertheless firmly grounds the book in restorative justice theory and ongoing research. This book provides a sympathetic and realistic challenge to established school culture. -- International Review of Victimology<br><br>This publication makes a major contribution to conflict resolution in educational settings. Developing citizenship, team work, positive self-esteem, communication and co-operation are all promoted. It's an essential resource for practical application and a stimulating conduit for schools to consider new approaches when dealing with conflict. A number of photocopiable sheets are included for consideration, plus a useful reference. -- The Teacher<br><br>This excellent manual should give a substantial impetus to the use of restorative techniques such as mediation and conferencing where they are badly needed - schools. Full of practical programmes and illustrated by plenty of examples, Just Schools shows how restorative justice can be used to resolve difficulties from low level antagonism to more serious issues of bullying. It is much more jargon-free than many books of this kind, and draws on academic sources and personal experience. -- Children Now<br><br>In Just Schools, a brief history of restorative justice is followed by advice on developing it for yourself. With clear explanations of process and advice on many useful skills such as developing restorative approaches to difficult situations, this is useful reading even if you have nothing to do with schools! Rooted in experience, this book is welcoming and workmanlike - recommended. -- Restorative Justice News<br><br>The different responses to conflict discussed here provide practitioners with knowledge they need to offer a more flexible approach to schools, and the text clearly shows that restorative practices are not the soft option that so many people take them to be. I recommend this book both to practitioners and to the schools they are looking to work with. -- Mediation Matters<br><br>Step-by-step demonstrations of Restorative Justice approaches are both compelling and practical. The book is clear, highly readable, methodical and well structured. Uncluttered photocopyable sheets provide valuable resources for those working in an educational setting who seek ways of responding more effectively to conflict disruption. -- Pastoral Care</p><h2>Laws of Media: The New Science</h2><p><p>Marshall McLuhan has been described as Canada's most exciting and original thinker, a member of the small company of intellectual geniuses this country has produced. Works such as <em>The Gutenberg Galaxy</em>, <em> The Mechanical Bride </em>, <em>From Cliche to Archetype </em>, and <em>Understanding Media</em> have established his reputation throughout the world and have profoundly influenced our understanding of contemporary communication. In his later years McLuhan was working on a 'unified field' theory of human culture, an effort in which he collaborated with and was assisted by his son, Eric McLuhan. This book is the result of that collaboration. <br>The McLuhans are retrieving another way of understanding our world, a way known to some ancient Greeks (but not Aristotle), to medieval thinkers, to Francis Bacon and Giambattista Vico, and to T.S. Eliot and James Joyce in this century. It is based on the use of words and the conseuqent power of the 'logos' to shape all the elements of culture - media - with which we surround ourselves. <br> The authors explain how the invention of the alphabet led to the dominance of visual-space conceptualizations over those of acoustic space and its creative words (and word-plays). They consider the differences between the left- and right-hand sides of our brains, and use Gestalt theories of figure and ground to explore the underlying principles that define media. <br> 'Media,' the word so closely connected with Marshall McLuhan's thought, is here explored in its broadest meaning, encompassing all that has been created by humans: artefacts, information, ideas - every example of human innovation, from computer program to a tea cup, from musical arrangement to the formula for a cold remedy, from an X-ray machine to the sentence you're reading right now. All these are media to whcih can be applied the laws the McLuhans have developed. <br>The laws are based on a set of four questions - a tetrad - that can be applied to any artefact or idea: <br>What does it enhance or intensify? <br>What does it render obsolete or displace? <br>What does it retrieve that was previoulsy obsolesced? <br>What does it produce or become when pressed to an extreme? <br> Inherent in every human innovation is an answer to each of the questions of this tetrad; anything that does not contain answers to these four questions is not the product of human creation. <br>The laws identified by the McLuhans consitute a new scientific basis for media studies, testable, and able to allow for prediction. It takes in all human activities and speech; it breaks down barriers and reconsiders them as mere intervals. In the McLuhan tradition, this New Science offers a while new understanding of human creation, and a vision that could reshape our future.</p></p><p>Before you have gone very far in this book, you will have found many familiar themes and topics. Be assured: this is not just a rehashing of old fare dished up between new covers, but a genuinely new food for thought and meditation.<b>Eric McLuhan</b> is an author, editor, and teacher.

By the end of the middle ages there were hundreds of schools, supporting a highly literate society. This book traces their history from the Romans to the Renaissance, showing how they developed, what they taught, how they were run, and who attended them.<br><br> Every kind of school is covered, from reading schools in churches and town grammar schools to schools in monasteries and nunneries, business schools, and theological schools.

It is an awe-inspiring, supremely desirable gift from the gods, essential to the perpetuation of a man's name through reproduction; yet it also grants women terrifying power over men, posing a threat inseparable from its allure. The myth of Helen is the central site in which the ancient Greeks expressed and reworked their culture's anxieties about erotic desire. Despite the passage of three millennia, contemporary culture remains almost obsessively preoccupied with all the power and danger of female beauty and sexuality that Helen still represents. Yet Helen, the embodiment of these concerns for our purported cultural ancestors, has been little studied from this perspective. Such issues are also central to contemporary feminist thought. <br><br><em>Helen of Troy</em> engages with the ancient origins of the persistent anxiety about female beauty, focusing on this key figure from ancient Greek culture in a way that both extends our understanding of that culture and provides a useful perspective for reconsidering aspects of our own. Moving from Homer and Hesiod to Sappho, Aeschylus, and Euripides, Ruby Blondell offers a fresh examination of the paradoxes and ambiguities that Helen embodies. In addition to literary sources, Blondell considers the archaeological record, which contains evidence of Helen's role as a cult figure, worshipped by maidens and newlyweds. The result is a compelling new interpretation of this alluring figure.<br></p><p><br> <b>Ruby Blondell</b> is Professor of Classics at the University of Washington. She has published widely on Greek literature, philosophy, and the use of myth in popular films. She is the author of books on Sophocles and Plato, co-editor and translator of <i>Women on the Edge: Four Plays by Euripides</i>, and editor and translator of <i>Sophocles: The Theban Plays</i>.&nbsp;<br>"These brief summaries do not begin to do justice to the subtle twists and turns of Blondell's analysis, but I hope that they at least give an idea of the kinds of issues she deals with repeatedly throughout this challenging and rewarding book. While the absence of the Greek texts and the traditional scholarly apparatus is occasionally frustrating, I would not hesitate to recommend this book either to an advanced undergraduate or to a professional scholar. In fact, I have already done so." --Deborah Lyons, <em>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</em><p></p><br>"This excellent volume takes the reader on a tour with Helen of Troy, as she journeys from <br>the Archetype (Pandora) through her complex identities in the <em>Iliad</em>, the <em>Odyssey</em>, the <em>Oresteia</em>, the lyric poets, Herodotus' <em>Histories</em>, Gorgias' <em>Encomium of Helen</em>, Euripides' <em>Trojan Women and Helen</em>, and finally Isocrates' <em>Encomium of Helen</em>. The book is descriptive in its focus, and shows that Helen, 'who is a concept, not a person' (p. xi), occupied roles that are important both in themselves and also for understanding the works in question. ... [Blondell] has achieved a miracle of lucid, useful and responsible accessibility. This jargon and footnote free volume will benefit scholars and students in classics, the humanities and beyond." --<em>The Classical Review</em><p></p><br>"Blondell's stimulating and provocative book demonstrates how Helen is 'an ever-refreshing screen for the projection of ideas and ideals about beauty, women, sex and power.' Demonized, idolized, allegorized, or humanized, Helen of Troy remains no woman and every woman." --<em>Bookslut</em> <br><p></p><br>"A compelling new portrait of the most famous femme fatale in history as she appears in Greek myth and literature." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Readers need not be scholars of Greek poetry and culture to appreciate this engaging look at an epic tale with modern resonance." --<em>Booklist</em> <br><p></p><br>"If you have an appreciation for the classics or even just strong feminine roles, you will want to pick this book up. It will easily become a favorite amongst the rest of your library for years to come." --<em>citybookreview.com</em> <br><p></p><br>"An entertaining and lively narrative...." --<em>Library Journal</em> <br><p></p><br>"An insightful book, filled with salacious tales of morality that the ancient Greeks did better than anyone since, Blondell's <em>Helen of Troy</em> is a real beauty." --Clifford Cunningham, <em>Sun News Miami</em><p></p><br>"A marvelously comprehensive look at Helen of Troy and her interpretations--literary, dramatic, and historical--through the ages. Every dimension of the myth of Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world and immortal in memory, is explored and analyzed. It leaves you awed and enlightened." --Margaret George, author of <em>Helen of Troy and The Memoirs of Cleopatra</em> <br><p></p><br>"Helen's face launched not only a thousand ships but also thousands of texts and artworks: Blondell's lucid, learned, but light-handed study shows why." --Glenn Most, University of Chicago<p></p><br>"A broad, subtle, and beautifully-written study that deserves a large and varied readership. Combining shrewd analysis with lightly-worn expertise, Blondell shows how Greek culture turned again and again to the myth of Helen to confront the disquieting power of female beauty." --Sheila Murnaghan, University of Pennsylvania<p></p><br>"Blondell has written a rich and penetrating study of the Helen myth in the Greek world." <br>--<em>New Republic</em><p></p><br>"This book is a fine demonstration of the way in which textual accounts of a Greek <br>legendary icon can be probed in depth to reveal nuances of cultural history that could <br>easily be overlooked. While it is no surprise that a study of Helen should uncover ways <br>in which the masculine agenda of patriarchal Greece was confirmed, Blondell has also <br>exposed the often self-serving and illogical measures taken by Greek writers to accomplish <br>this. She does this with a freshness often quickened by humour" --<em>Phoenix</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Royal Commentaries of the Incas and General History of Peru, Abridged</h2><p><p>This new abridgment of both volumes of Livermore's classic translation presents those selections that comprise Garcilaso's historical narrative.

It has a wonderfully enlightening Introduction and the texts are well selected, allowing students to grasp the breath, complexity, and importance of Garcilaso's work.

By publishing both parts of his history together . . . Spalding encourages students to compare the rational Inca state with the corruption anad deception of Spanish administrators--exactly as Garcilaso had intended. . . . Spalding's abridgment of Garcilaso carefully includes excerpts from the major issues detailed in Garcilaso's rich history. --R. Jovita Baber, (University of Illinois-Champaign), in <i>The Sixteenth Century Journal</i></p><br><br><p>Karen Spalding has taken this acclaimed translation of both Royal Commentaries and its less-often-read second part, General History of Peru, to produce an outstanding abridged version of the complete work aimed at undergraduate students but that is also appropriate for a learned general audience curious about Peru's Inca past and the Spanish conquest. . . . This is an excellent introduction to a classic of Latin American Letters. By editing both parts together and giving them equal space, Spalding enables readers to see how Garcilaso argued that the Inca leaders prepared Andean people for the arrival of Christianity and that this possibility was tragically destroyed by the greed and lack of virtue of the conquistadores, who destroyed the social and economic basis of Inca society. --Luis Millones Figueroa, Colby College</p></p><h2>The Belton Estate</h2><p><p>ReadHowYouWant publishes a wide variety of best selling books in Large and Super Large fonts in partnership with leading publishers.

Since his student days in the early 50s, American painter and sculptor Cy Twombly, one of the greatest artists alive today, has concerned himself with photography. In this volume, he presents his photographic work of 50 years to the public for the first time ever. Taking up 19th-century Pictorialist traditions, Twombly&#x2019;s photographs are, just like his paintings, drawings and sculptures, documents of a profound personal poetry. Studio shots, details of his own statuary, sculptures from his collection, romantic landscapes, flowers, and portraits of friends constitute the cosmos of his photographic oeuvre. Printed with matte colors on matte paper, a special "dryprint" process lends these images a velvety, porous, almost grainy quality. On the stage of today&#x2019;s art, they touch long-lost chords. Resonant of the concepts of fin de si�cle art they are, yet, thoroughly contemporary in their minimalism, creating an aesthetic vision by the commonest means.</p><p>This world premiere is an aesthetic sensation.

In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy&#39;s parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.</p><p>Here, for a change, is a fish tale that actually does honour to the author. In fact <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> revived Ernest Hemingway's career, which was foundering under the weight of such post-war stinkers as <i>Across the River and into the Trees</i>. It also led directly to his receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1954 (an award Hemingway gladly accepted, despite his earlier observation that "no son of a bitch that ever won the Nobel Prize ever wrote anything worth reading afterwards"). A half century later, it's still easy to see why. This tale of an aged Cuban fisherman going head-to-head (or hand-to-fin) with a magnificent marlin encapsulates Hemingway's favourite motifs of physical and moral challenge. Yet Santiago is too old and infirm to partake of the gun-toting machismo that disfigured much of the author's later work: <blockquote> "The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords." </blockquote> Hemingway's style, too, reverts to those superb snapshots of perception that won him his initial fame: <blockquote> Just before it was dark, as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a yellow blanket, his small line was taken by a dolphin. He saw it first when it jumped in the air, true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air. </blockquote> If a younger Hemingway had written this novella, Santiago most likely would have towed the enormous fish back to port and posed for a triumphal photograph--just as the author delighted in doing, circa 1935. Instead his prize gets devoured by a school of sharks. Returning with little more than a skeleton, he takes to his bed and, in the very last line, cements his identification with his creator: <blockquote> "The old man was dreaming about the lions." </blockquote> Perhaps there's some allegory of art and experience floating around in there somewhere--but <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> was, in any case, the last great catch of Hemingway's career. --<i>James Marcus</i>"It is unsurpassed in Hemingway's oeuvre. Every word tells and there is not a word too many" (Anthony Burgess)<br><br>"A quite wonderful example of narrative art. The writing is as taut, and at the same time as lithe and cunningly played out, as the line on which the old man plays the fish" (<i>Guardian</i>)</p><h2>The Essential Works of John Wesley: Selected Books, Sermons, and Other Writings</h2><p>Want to know how to live the Christian life?

Roberts's <em>History of the World</em>. Deftly written and evocatively illustrated, this book offers an outstanding one-volume survey of the major events, developments, and personalities of the known past.<br> In a truly remarkable work of compression and synthesis, Roberts sweeps through thousands of years of history, weaving the stories of empires, arts, religion, economics, and science into his lucid narrative. Beginning with the early hominids, he swiftly and authoritatively brings the story up through the emergence of Mesopotamian civilizations and ancient Egypt. Here, too, is comprehensive coverage of the Indian and Chinese civilizations ("For two and a half thousand years," he points out, "there has been a Chinese nation using a Chinese language"), as well as developments in Africa and South America. Aided by photographs of key archaelogical finds (such as monumental Egyptian statues, Peruvian medallions, and Celtic jewelry), Roberts clearly explains the early arts, engineering, and religion. He also carefully ties in changing economics--such as trade routes and developments in agriculture and manufacturing--making clear their importance for the history of politics and changing societies. The story leaps ahead, through the Roman Empire, the explosive arrival of Islam, the rise and fall of samurai rule in Japan, the medieval kingdoms of sub-Saharan Africa, the Mongol conquests, and the early modern expansion of Europe across the globe. American independence, the French Revolution, the colonial empires, Japan's startling modernization, and the World Wars follow in turn, accompanied by discussions of scientific and technical breakthroughs.<br> With informative maps, photographs, and reproductions of important artwork (some in full color), Roberts clearly explains the impact of the key individuals and the major influences on history the world over, down to the era of an integrated global economy and the fall of the U.S.S.R. Vividly written and beautifull illustrated, <em>History of the World</em> offers the finest, most readable one-volume survey available today.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>: <strong>J.M.

But it is also the book in which its author, through a brilliant adaptation of his stylistic apparatus to his obsessive moral, psychological and political concerns, laid the groundwork for the modern novel as we know it.<br><br>With An Introduction By Norman Sherry<br><br>An expert on the works of Joseph Conrad, Professor Norman Sherry is the author of Conrad's Eastern World, Conrad's Western World and Conrad and His World. He is also the editor of Conrad: The Critical Heritage, and the official biographer of Graham Greene.<br><br>(Book Jacket Status: Not Jacketed)<br><br></p></p><p>When <i>Lord Jim</i> first appeared in 1900, many took Joseph Conrad to task for couching an entire novel in the form of an extended conversation--a ripping good yarn, if you like. (One critic in <i>The Academy</i> complained that the narrator "was telling that after-dinner story to his companions for eleven solid hours.") Conrad defended his method, insisting that people really do talk for that long, and listen as well. In fact his chatty masterwork requires no defense--it offers up not only linguistic pleasures but a timeless exploration of morality.<p> The eponymous Jim is a young, good-looking, genial, and naive water-clerk on the <i>Patna</i>, a cargo ship plying Asian waters. He is, we are told, "the kind of fellow you would, on the strength of his looks, leave in charge of the deck." He also harbors romantic fantasies of adventure and heroism--which are promptly scuttled one night when the ship collides with an obstacle and begins to sink. Acting on impulse, Jim jumps overboard and lands in a lifeboat, which happens to be bearing the unscrupulous captain and his cohorts away from the disaster. The <i>Patna</i>, however, manages to stay afloat. The foundering vessel is towed into port--and since the officers have strategically vanished, Jim is left to stand trial for abandoning the ship and its 800 passengers. </p><p> Stripped of his seaman's license, convinced of his own cowardice, Jim sets out on a tragic and transcendent search for redemption. This may sound like the bleakest of narratives. But <i>Lord Jim</i> is also touching, elevating, and often funny. Here, for example, the narrator describes the ship's captain (proving that clothes do indeed make the man): </p><blockquote> He made me think of a trained baby elephant walking on hind-legs. He was extravagantly gorgeous too--got up in a soiled sleeping suit, bright green and deep orange vertical stripes, with a pair of ragged straw slippers on his bare feet, and somebody's cast-off pith hat, very dirty and two sizes too small for him, tied up with a manilla rope-yarn on the top of his big head. You understand a man like that hasn't a ghost of a chance when it comes to borrowing clothes. </blockquote> This is formidable prose by any standard. But when you consider that Conrad was working in his third language, the sublime after-dinner story that is <i>Lord Jim</i> seems even more astonishing an accomplishment. <i>--Teri Kieffer</i>This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

The hero of the novel, the "Virginian", the only name by which he is known, has left his native state at an early age to try his fortunes in the western country. After roughing it along the way, he settles on Judge Henry's cattle ranch in Wyoming, where the owner makes him his right-hand man. The Virginian is strikingly handsome, twetny-seven years old, and, though unversed in the ways of the world and ignorant as to book learning, he has character and personality that inspire respect from all who know him. He manages to force on a turbulent community his idea of law and order-- "getting the drop" on an enemy, vigilante committees, and lynch law. </p><p>The novel recounts his adventures, including his romantic initiation at the hands of Molly Wood, the Vermont girl who became a western school techer. And it introduces him to Trampas, the legendary villain who is the prototype of the "bad guys" of future western novels and films. </p><p>"The Virginian" has been filmed three times, most memorably with Gary Cooper, and also became a long-running television series.</p><b>Owen Wister </b>(1860-1938) was born in Philadelphia and raised in Germantown, Pennsylvania.

Some of the savviest people on Wall Street have taken his Columbia Business School executive education course on the subject. Now this dynamic and popular teacher, with some colleagues, reveals the fundamental principles of value investing, the one investment technique that has proven itself consistently over time. After covering general techniques of value investing, the book proceeds to illustrate their applications through profiles of Warren Buffett, Michael Price, Mario Gabellio, and other successful value investors. A number of case studies highlight the techniques in practice.<br> Bruce C. N. Greenwald (New York, NY) is the Robert Heilbrunn Professor of Finance and Asset Management at Columbia University. Judd Kahn, PhD (New York, NY), is a member of Morningside Value Investors. Paul D. Sonkin (New York, NY) is the investment manager of the Hummingbird Value Fund. Michael van Biema (New York, NY) is an Assistant Professor at the Graduate School of Business, Columbia University.</p><p>Individual investors in the Internet Age are blessed with information. We also are cursed with too much of the stuff, from real-time quotes to streaming videos of fund managers. This info-clutter extends to books, and cutting through it can be difficult, even dispiriting, when you see how little thought goes into so many books. That's why I've spent part of the summer doing it for you. And the new title most deserving of your time is Value Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond. Its authors, Columbia Business School faculty members Bruce C.N. Greenwald and Michael Van Biema and fund managers Paul D. Sonkin and Judd Kahn, aim to place their work next to Benjamin Graham's 1950 classic, The Intelligent Investor. My 1986 edition came with Warren Buffett's endorsement--"by far the best book on investing ever written." Value Investing is better. --Robert Barker, <i>BusinessWeek</i>, AUGUST 13, 2001 <p>No one can doubt there's an urgent need to think clearly about investing, since many investors in Silicon Valley companies have suffered a stock market decline comparable to the Crash of '29. The burned investor could find no better starting place than this superb book by four New York City value investors, all descended from the master of value investing, Benjamin Graham.... They have written one of the most intelligent overviews of investing I've ever read, combining analytical rigor with intuitive description." --DAVID A. SYLVESTER, <i>San Jose Mercury News</i>, Oct. 21, 2001 </p><p>Greenwald is a conventional economist (Ph.D. from MIT) who caught the value bug. He has updated and expanded Graham's ideas, and his summer seminars ($2,900 for two days) have become popular with everyone from well-known money managers to Columbia MBAs who couldn't get into Greenwald's class. But now there is a cheaper way to learn from Greenwald: He and three colleagues have just published "Value Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond." Greenwald probably won't outsell Graham, but I think he ought to. --Paul Sturm, <i>SmartMoney Magazine</i>, June 19, 2001 </p><p>"Whether you've been working with stocks for years or are a beginner looking for a book that goes beyond price/earnings ratios, you'll likely get something worthwhile out of the book. I certainly did." &#x2014;Pat Dorsey, <i>Morningstar</i>, 11/7/2001 </p><p>"I finally have a good solution for those wanting an updated manual on value investing. Value Investing [is] essential reading for anyone looking for a fresh perspective on analyzing companies and selecting investments. Those with a little background in finance will benefit from the book's clear prose and its profiles of eight successful value investors, and stock-market veterans will enjoy the detailed case studies in which Greenwald applies his ideas to specific companies.... It is one of the better books on investing to hit the shelves in a while. Greenwald's detailed analysis of Intel INTC is by itself worth the price of admission, and other examples are similarly illuminating. Whether you've been working with stocks for years or are a beginner looking for a book that goes beyond price/earnings ratios, you'll likely get something worthwhile out of the book." (Secrets of Successful Investing' by Pat Dorsey, Morningstar.com) </p><p>"Value Investing [is] essential reading for anyone looking for a fresh perspective on analyzing companies and selecting investments." &#x2014;Pat Dorsey, Morningstar.com </p><p> "Sophisticated yet accessible to people outside the orbit of business schools, Greenwald's book is a lively defense of, and handbook for, value investing, complete with glimpses of how it's practiced by pros like Warren Buffett and Mario Gabelli." &#x2014;TheStreet.com, November 15, 2001</p>Described by the New York Times as the "guru to Wall Street's gurus," Bruce Greenwald is a leading authority on value investing. His courses and seminars on the subject have drawn some of the savviest people in the investment world. Now, along with some colleagues, Greenwald reveals the fundamental principles that have made value investing one of the most consistently profitable investment techniques.<br> <br> In an investment world frequently blinded by excessive optimism, short-term speculation, and other practices ranging from unsound to downright shady, value investing remains a reliable discipline even as it moves into a new century. Built on the works of Benjamin Graham, the father of security analysis, value investing is based on the premise that the underlying value of a financial security is measurable and stable, even though the market price fluctuates widely. The core of value investing is to buy securities when their market prices are significantly below their intrinsic values. Graham called the gap between price and value the "margin of safety." A large margin of safety both increases the potential return and reduces the risk of loss.<br> <br> In Value Investing, the authors enrich the discipline by exploring its history, explaining its underlying principles, and setting guidelines for its successful application. The book covers such indispensable issues as:<br> * Where to look for underpriced securities<br> * How to determine the intrinsic value of a stock<br> * Alternative methods for constructing a portfolio that control risk without restricting investment returns<br> <br> After discussing the basis of value investing, the book describes the proven techniques of some of the greatest value investors in history, including Warren<br> <br> Buffett, Walter Schloss, Mario Gabelli, and Michael Price. By adapting Graham's strategies to accommodate new investment climates, each has contributed a distinctive thread to make the discipline of value investing stronger and more flexible.<br> <br> Value Investing is a must for any serious investor wishing to gain a better understanding of the principles and practices behind this time-tested approach. It will earn a place on the bookshelf next to Graham and Dodd's Security Analysis and Graham's The Intelligent Investor.</p><h2>SAS Programming in the Pharmaceutical Industry, Second Edition</h2><p><b>This comprehensive resource provides on-the-job training for statistical programmers who use SAS in the pharmaceutical industry.</b> <p> This one-stop resource offers a complete review of what entry- to intermediate-level statistical programmers need to know in order to help with the analysis and reporting of clinical trial data in the pharmaceutical industry. </p><p> <i>SAS Programming in the Pharmaceutical Industry, Second Edition</i> begins with an introduction to the pharmaceutical industry and the work environment of a statistical programmer.

Their writing is articulate and their explanations are in-depth, but they provide little how-to. Chapters encompass a wide variety of natural construction methods and materials. The planning sections really shine. Verdict: This guide stands out for the wealth of information it provides on green construction basics and planning. A solid addition to building collections.</p><br><br><p><em><strong>Choice-</strong></em><br><br>"Natural building is broader in its approach and scope than green building," state Racusin and McArleton (both, Yestermorrow Design/Build School instructors) in <em>The Natural Building Companion</em>. The volume's 21 chapters, which cover topics ranging from soil and acoustics to straw bale and energy electricity, are divided into three parts: &#x2018;The Context for Natural Building,&#x2019; &#x2018;Building Science and Performance,&#x2019; and &#x2018;Natural Building Practices.&#x2019; The natural techniques described all speak to broader concerns about better, healthier ways of building, intended to eliminate volatile organic compound (VOC) off-gassing; and to create living environments that are designed and built as if climate mattered. These approaches also aim to reduce buildings' reliance on expensive and energy-consuming mechanical systems for maintaining comfortable living conditions. On a more detailed level, the authors delve into product ingredients, e.g., lime in mortars. They even supply recipes for finishes. Their view is that designing and building shelter to meet a wide range of human needs and local environmental conditions need not be a luxury. An additional bonus is an instructional DVD that allows readers to visualize many of the techniques the authors discuss. This book is an excellent hands-on companion to any and all books on architecture. Summing Up: Highly recommended. Lower-division undergraduates and above; general readers.</p><br><br><p>"A thorough treatment of both the context for and specifics of natural building, this book is a wealth of resources all in one place. Though geared to the Atlantic Northeast, there is still more than enough here to make it a must-read for natural builders everywhere."<strong>--Bruce King, author of <em>Design of Straw Bale Buildings</em> and <em>Buildings of Earth and Straw</em></strong><br> <br> </p><br><br><p>"Fun. Easy to Read. Details that are useful in just about any climate, but particularly in cold climates. As the title clearly states, this book is a true 'companion' to take along on one's natural building journey. A well-thought-out account of Jacob and Ace's experiences and the methods they have evolved over the years. One of the best natural building books published in recent years."<strong>--Bill Steen, coauthor, <em>The Straw Bale House</em></strong><br> <br> </p><br><br><p>"<em>The Natural Building Companion</em> is a joy to read. The approach is holistic, the style is generous, and the authors gracefully balance technical details, beautiful spaces, and big ecological questions. This book empowers the reader to make choices that matter-for their own home and for the health of our planet."<strong>--Paul Lacinski, coauthor of <em>Serious Straw Bale</em></strong><br> <br> </p><br><br><p>"This excellent and thoroughly researched book reflects the progression of natural building. It eloquently expresses the beautiful marriage between experience and experimentation, fact and anecdote, science and soul. Deva and Ace have built us a much needed bridge between natural building and green building. <em>The Natural Building Companion</em> will transform how we build!"<strong>--Adam Weismann and Katy Bryce, authors of <em>Using Natural Finishes</em> and <em>Building with Cob</em></strong><br> <br> </p><br><br><p>"<em>The Natural Building Companion</em> brings age-old building techniques and materials into the modern world. It is a comprehensive evaluation of natural building methods that shares results from up-to-date testing and monitoring, explains how these results apply to building codes, and covers new tools and resources that make installation more user-friendly and durable. By combining a wealth of information in a single volume, this book is indispensable to anyone wanting to build a healthy home using natural materials."<strong>--Will Beemer, director, The Heartwood School for the Homebuilding Crafts</strong><br> <br> </p><br><br><p>"'What is a high-performance building?' Racusin and McArleton answer that question by taking a values-based approach that integrates social and ecological good with health, resource efficiency, and durability. Fusing the knowledge of the building-science community with the wisdom and experience of the best natural building practitioners, <em>The Natural Building Companion</em> provides plenty of detailed, how-to information to help readers create structures and communities that are, as the authors put it, 'worthy of our highest aspirations.'"<strong>--Marc Rosenbaum, founder, Energysmiths</strong><br> <br> </p></p><h2>Kane and Abel/The Prodigal Daughter/Not a Penny More/Quiver Full of Arrows: Kane and Abel, the Prodigal Daughter, Not a Penny More, Quiver Full of Arrows</h2><p>complete and unabridged</p><p></p><h2>Deviant Behavior (11th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b>Deviant Behavior <i>challenges students&#x2019; own biases and preconceptions.</i> </b> </p> <p> <b>&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>This best-selling text offers comprehensive coverage of all aspects of deviance and is noted for its blend of style and substance.<b>&nbsp;</b> <i>Deviant Behavior</i>&nbsp;covers a wide spectrum of theories of deviance, and analyzes numerous specific deviant behaviors.

Taken away from his parents, he was brought up in Lhasa according to a monastic regimen of rigorous austerity and in almost total isolation. Aged seven he was enthroned in the 1000-room Potala palace as the supreme spiritual leader of a nation the size of Western Europe, with population of six million. And at fifteen, he became head of state.With Tibet under threat from the newly Communist Chinese, there followed a traumatic decade during which he became the confidant of both Chairman Mao and Jawaharal Nehru as he tried to maintain autonomy for his people. Then in 1959, he was finally forced into exile - followed by over 100,000 destitute refugees.Here, in his own words, he describes what it was like to grow up revered as a deity among his people, reveals his innermost feelings about his role, and discusses the mysteries of Tibetan Buddhism.</p><p>The Dalai Lama's autobiography should leave no one in doubt of his humility and genuine compassion. Written without the slightest hint of pretense, the exiled leader of Tibet recounts his life, from the time he was whisked away from his home in 1939 at the age of 4, to his treacherous escape from Tibet in 1959, to his winning of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. The backdrop of the story is the 1950 Chinese invasion of Tibet. He calmly relates details of imprisonment, torture, rape, famine, ecological disaster, and genocide that under four decades of Chinese rule have left 1.25 million Tibetans dead and the Tibetan natural and religious landscapes decimated. Yet the Dalai Lama's story is strangely one of hope. This man who prays for four hours a day harbors no ill will toward the Chinese and sees the potential for good everywhere he casts his gaze. Someday, he hopes, all of Tibet will be a zone of peace and the world's largest nature preserve. Such optimism is not naive but rather a result of his daily studies in Buddhist philosophy and his doctrine of Universal Responsibility. Inspiring in every way, <i>Freedom in Exile</i> is both a historical document and a fable of deepest trust in humanity. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>The Dalai Lama is the head of the Buddhist &#39;religion&#39;. He was chosen to be the reincarnation of all the previous Dalai Lamas as a two year old boy.</p><h2>Bonsai With American Trees</h2><p>Adapts the basic principles and techniques of the Japanese art of dwarfing trees to soil types, weather conditions, fertilizers, and native species found in the United States</p><p></p><h2>Organizational Behaviour</h2><p>Offering a strong combination of theory and analysis, <em>Organizational Behaviour</em> is an engaging text that looks at the debates surrounding the subject, encouraging students to think critically about the key issues involved. <br> It been fully revised and updated to include the latest organizational behavior research and has a new chapter on managing knowledge.</p><p><br>Professor Robin Fincham is Professor of Organizational Behaviour in the department of Management and Organization at Stirling University Peter Rhodes is a management consultant working for OTL Management Consultancy<br>` Princliples of Organizational Behaviour by Robin Fincham and Peter Rhodes is a clear, well-structured and comprehensive textbook that combines a psychological and sociological approach to the subject of organisational studies.

They have relied on their superior technology to do so, yet these technologies have not always guaranteed success. <i>Power over Peoples</i> examines Western imperialism's complex relationship with technology, from the first Portuguese ships that ventured down the coast of Africa in the 1430s to America's conflicts in the Middle East today.</p><br><p> Why did the sailing vessels that gave the Portuguese a century-long advantage in the Indian Ocean fail to overcome Muslim galleys in the Red Sea? Why were the same weapons and methods that the Spanish used to conquer Mexico and Peru ineffective in Chile and Africa? Why didn't America's overwhelming air power assure success in Iraq and Afghanistan? In <i>Power over Peoples</i>, Daniel Headrick traces the evolution of Western technologies--from muskets and galleons to jet planes and smart bombs--and sheds light on the environmental and social factors that have brought victory in some cases and unforeseen defeat in others. He shows how superior technology translates into greater power over nature and sometimes even other peoples, yet how technological superiority is no guarantee of success in imperialist ventures--because the technology only delivers results in a specific environment, or because the society being attacked responds in unexpected ways.</p><br><p> Breathtaking in scope, <i>Power over Peoples</i> is a revealing history of technological innovation, its promise and limitations, and its central role in the rise and fall of empire.</p></p><p><p>"This is a major contribution to historical studies, as well as the study of technological change and economic history.

It emphasizes the role of basic scientific principles in helping understand the processes that govern the ocean and the earth.. . <p>A major objective of the text is to stimulate student interest and curiosity by blending contemporary information and research with basic principles to form an integrated introduction to the sciences of the oceans. To keep the text as current as possible, the authors conduct their own research and examine other findings such as analyzing satellite data and large-scale oceanographic programs. From this vast amount of data, they select interesting, relevant, and understandable examples that illustrate contemporary principles of oceanography.. . </p><p><i>An Introduction to the World's Oceans</i> places greater emphasis on the physical and geological aspects of the oceans than on the chemical and geochemical properties, because the latter disciplines require more specific background knowledge. An ecological approach helps integrate the biological chapters with other subjects. Students are encouraged to look at oceanography as a cohesive and united discipline rather than a collection of subjects gathered under a marine umbrella. As with all previous editions, the authors continue to make each chapter stand as independently as possible, so that professors can assign chapters in the order that best suits their classrooms. .</p></p><p>Keith Sverdrup is a professor at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee.</p><h2>Precalculus</h2><p>Three components contribute to a theme sustained throughout the Coburn Series: that of laying a firm foundation, building a solid framework, and providing strong connections. Not only does Coburn present a sound problem-solving process to teach students to recognize a problem, organize a procedure, and formulate a solution, the text encourages students to see beyond procedures in an effort to gain a greater understanding of the big ideas behind mathematical concepts. <br> <br> Written in a readable, yet mathematically mature manner appropriate for college algebra level students, Coburn&#x2019;s Precalculus uses narrative, extensive examples, and a range of exercises to connect seemingly disparate mathematical topics into a cohesive whole. Coburn&#x2019;s hallmark applications are born out of the author&#x2019;s extensive experiences in and outside the classroom, and appeal to the vast diversity of students and teaching methods in this course area. <br> <br> Benefiting from the feedback of hundreds of instructors and students across the country, Precalculus second edition, continues to emphasize connections in order to improve the level of student engagement in mathematics and increase their chances of success in college algebra. <br> <br></p><p>John Coburn grew up in the Hawaiian Islands, the seventh of sixteen children.

After being lured into the business world for five years, he returned to his first love, accepting a teaching position in high school mathematics where he was recognized as Teacher of the Year in 1987. Soon afterward, the decision was made to seek a Masters Degree, which he received two years later from the University of Oklahoma. For the last fifteen years, he has been teaching mathematics at the Florissant Valley campus of St. Louis Community College, where he is now a full professor.

Private Cases In Neaeram (59) (Loeb Classical Library No. 351) (Volume VI)</h2><p><p>Demosthenes (384&#x2013;322 BCE), orator at Athens, was a pleader in law courts who later became also a statesman, champion of the past greatness of his city and the present resistance of Greece to the rise of Philip of Macedon to supremacy. We possess by him political speeches and law-court speeches composed for parties in private cases and political cases. His early reputation as the best of Greek orators rests on his steadfastness of purpose, his sincerity, his clear and pungent argument, and his severe control of language. In his law cases he is the advocate, in his political speeches a castigator not of his opponents but of their politics. Demosthenes gives us vivid pictures of public and private life of his time.</p><p>The Loeb Classical Library edition of Demosthenes is in seven volumes.</p></p><p><p>Augustus Taber Murray (1866&#x2013;1940) was Professor of Greek at Stanford University.</p></p><h2>The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology: A User&#39;s Guide to Sociological Language</h2><p>This new edition of Allan G.

This advocate of equality for women combined an artistic vision of photography with determination and a love of adventure to forge a distinguished career spanning half a century. <br>Originally trained as an artist, Wootten worked in photography's pictorial tradition, emphasizing artistic effect in her images at a time when realistic and documentary photography increasingly dominated the medium. Traveling throughout North Carolina and surrounding states, she turned the artistry of her eye and lens on the people and places she encountered. <br>Having opened a studio in her hometown of New Bern in 1905, Wootten moved to Chapel Hill in 1928, where her clients included the University of North Carolina. Between 1932 and 1941, she also provided photographs for six books--including <i>Cabins in the Laurel</i>, <i>Old Homes and Gardens of North Carolina</i>, and <i>Charleston: Azaleas and Old Bricks</i>--lectured extensively, and exhibited her photographs as far away as New York and Massachusetts.<br><i>Light and Air</i> features 190 illustrations, including 136 duotone reproductions of Wootten's photographs taken in North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, and Tennessee--many of which have never before been published. Though she was an accomplished landscape and architectural photographer, some of Wootten's most notable images were the portraits she crafted of black and white Americans in the lower reaches of society, working people whom other photographers often ignored. These images are perhaps her most enduring legacy.<br><br></p><p>"This book, with 136 duotones, recovers the images of a little known but highly accomplished regional artist."-- <i>Women's Art Journal</i> <br>A study of the life and work of Bayard Wootten, one of the South&#39;s first female photographers.

Barnstone preserves the original song of the Bible, rendering a large part in poetry and the epic Revelation in incantatory blank verse. This monumental translation is the first to restore the original Greek, Aramaic, and Hebrew names (Markos for Mark, Yeshua for Jesus), thereby revealing the Greco-Jewish identity of biblical people and places. Citing historical and biblical scholarship, he changes the sequence of texts and adds three seminal Gnostic gospels. Each book has elegant introductions and is thoroughly annotated. With its superlative writing and lyrical wisdom, <em>The Restored New Testament</em> is a magnificent biblical translation for our age.</p><p>Praise for <em>The Restored New Testament</em>:<br><br> &#x201c;Barnstone&#x2019;s new English version of the core texts of Christian scripture is almost startling in its freshness. Scraping away many centuries of stylistic fussiness and supersessionist distortion, he gives us a set of Gospel narratives that are bold and direct in their simplicity and that show how steeped the first Christians were in the Jewish world from which they derived.&#x201d;&#x2015;Robert Alter<br><br> &#x201c;Willis Barnstone&#x2019;s <em>The Restored New Testament</em> is both an eloquent, fresh translation of the Four Gospels and of Revelation, and also a superb act of restoration, in which these Christian scriptures are returned to their Judaic origins and context. The introductory material is wise and poignant, and makes an authentic contribution to the common reader&#x2019;s understanding of the Gospels.&#x201d;&#x2015;Harold Bloom<br><br> &#x201c;Willis Barnstone&#x2019;s <em>The Restored New Testament</em> is breathtaking, new, astounding. It is a courageous, a daring book; but, by some magic, it appears not nouveau and experimental but deeply rooted and ancient. Did you think Jerome&#x2019;s or Tyndale&#x2019;s or James&#x2019;s &#x2018;Song of the Sparrows&#x2019; from Matthew was thrilling? Look at Barnstone&#x2019;s. Or look at his version of Paul&#x2019;s heartbreaking lines of love in Corinthians 13. If Barnstone, through a long life of poetry, translation, story, and memoir, in language after language, had nothing else but this book, it would be a lifetime of extraordinary achievement. We are blessed by it.&#x201d;&#x2015;Gerald Stern<br><br> &#x201c;Much will always remain obscure about the humane and undogmatic rabbi Yeshua, who may or may not have aspired to be his people&#x2019;s prophesied Messiah. Indeed, there is no uncontested evidence that he ever lived. Nevertheless, he is the protagonist of narratives as powerful as The Iliad in their quite opposite spirit. What we learn from Willis Barnstone is that the gentle teacher who can still be discerned in those stories had little in common with the man-god whose cult, over two millennia, has licensed the persecution of Yeshua's own folk. The always amazing Barnstone has outdone even himself in this beautiful, scholarly, yet profoundly subversive book.&#x201d;&#x2015;Frederick Crews<strong>Willis Barnstone</strong>, professor, poet, and scholar, is the author of eighty volumes, including <em>The Restored New Testament</em>, <em>The Gnostic Bible</em>, <em>The Poems of Jesus Christ</em>, <em>The Poetics of Translation</em>, and <em>Mexico in My Heart: New and Selected Poems</em>.

I, like most, had heard of the 70 page Pestana pdf floating around and used that for the first 5 weeks of my rotation. Had I known sooner about this expanded version I would have made the switch ages ago. It is a very easy read written in a similar tone Dr. Pestana's surgery review. He distills only high-yield facts and adds many clinical pearls. Surgical Recall is an excellent resource for on the wards and OR pimping but this text is invaluable because it cuts through the additional low-yield nonsense that Lawrence provides and gives you what you need for the test. Many times during the shelf I wanted to mentally caress Dr. Pestana's insane eyesbrows as the questions seemed as if they had been taken right out of the book.

Among these are some very popular rock garden plants, such as Calochortus, Erythronium, and Fritillaria, which have never had anything substantial written about them in book form. Others, including Calydorea, Hypoxis, and Muilla, are not as well known outside specialist collections. The characteristics that make bulbs so desirable in gardens include their great diversity of flowering time, color, size, and form; their ability to adapt to a wide range of environments; and their capacity to multiply and spread without a gardener&#39;s intervention. Amateur botanists and horticulturists, particularly those with an interest in alpine and rock gardens, and travelers planning a field trip to choice plant-viewing sites all over the continent, will be inspired by this firsthand account of native North American bulbs.

Were the framers enlightened, disinterested statesmen seeking to rescue a nation then drifting dangerously toward anarchy? Were they conspiratorial representatives of a rising financial and industrial capitalism? Was the Constitution primarily an economic or a political document? This collection of essays, by such renowned scholars as Charles Beard, Andrew C. McLaughlin, and John P. Roche, addresses the myriad questions that surround the creation of the principal document of the American governmental system. With a revised introduction and conclusion, the second edition is an indispensable and timely tool for courses in American government and constitutional history.<br></p><p>This highly-acclaimed collection of essays, edited by eminent constitutional historian Leonard W.

In this new book Hawking takes us to the cutting edge of theoretical physics, where truth is often stranger than fiction, to explain in laymen's terms the principles that control our universe. </p><p>Like many in the community of theoretical physicists, Professor Hawking is seeking to uncover the grail of science -- the elusive Theory of Everything that lies at the heart of the cosmos. In his accessible and often playful style, he guides us on his search to uncover the secrets of the universe -- from supergravity to supersymmetry, from quantum theory to M-theory, from holography to duality. </p><p>He takes us to the wild frontiers of science, where superstring theory and p-branes may hold the final clue to the puzzle. And he lets us behind the scenes of one of his most exciting intellectual adventures as he seeks "to combine Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and Richard Feynman's idea of multiple histories into one complete unified theory that will describe everything that happens in the universe." </p><p>With characteristic exuberance, Professor Hawking invites us to be fellow travelers on this extraordinary voyage through space-time. Copious four-color illustrations help clarify this journey into a surreal wonderland where particles, sheets, and strings move in eleven dimensions; where black holes evaporate and disappear, taking their secret with them; and where the original cosmic seed from which our own universe sprang was a tiny nut. </p><p><i>The Universe in a Nutshell</i> is essential reading for all of us who want to understand the universe in which we live. Like its companion volume, A Brief History of Time, it conveys the excitement felt within the scientific community as the secrets of the cosmos reveal themselves. </p><p><b><i>The Illustrated Brief History of Time</i></b><br> In the years since its publication in 1988, Stephen Hawking's <i>A Brief History of Time</i> has established itself as a landmark volume in scientific writing. It has also become an international publishing phenomenon, translated into forty languages and selling over nine million copies. The book was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the nature of the universe, but since then there have been extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic world. These observations have confirmed many of Professor Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book, including the recent discoveries of the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), which probed back in time to within 300,000 years of the universe's beginning and revealed the wrinkles in the fabric of space-time that he had projected. </p><p>Eager to bring to his original text the new knowledge revealed by these many observations, as well as his most recent research, for this revised and expanded edition Hawking has prepared a new introduction to the book, revised and updated the original chapters throughout, and written an entirely new chapter on the fascinating subject of wormholes and time travel. </p><p>In addition, to heighten understanding of complex concepts that readers may have found difficult to grasp despite the clarity and wit of Hawking's writing, this edition is magnificently enhanced throughout with more than 240 full-color illustrations, including satellite images, photographs made possible by spectacular new technological advances such as the Hubble telescope, and computer- generated images of three- and four-dimensional realities. Detailed captions clarify these illustrations, enabling readers to experience the vastness of intergalactic space, the nature of black holes, and the microcosmic world of particle physics in which matter and antimatter collide. </p><p>A classic work that now brings to the reader the latest understanding of cosmology, The Illustrated <i>A Brief History of Time</i> is the story of the ongoing search for the tantalizing secrets at the heart of time and space.</p></p><p></p><h2>Pitcairn&#39;s Island: A Novel</h2><p>MEN AGAINST THE SEA is the epic story of the 19 loyal men who, with Captain Bligh at the helm, were set adrift in a 23-foot open launch.

PITCAIRN&#39;s ISLAND unfolds a tale of drunkeness, betrayal, murder, and vengeance as it chronicles the fate of Christian, the mutineers, and a handful of Tahitians, who together take refuge on the loneliest island in the Pacific.</p><p>Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall (1887�1951), who served together as U.S. Air Service pilots in World War I, had a highly successful literary partnership that lasted nearly 30 years and produced several worldwide bestsellers.

Ferguson</h2><p><p><i><b>Essential reading on segregation.</b></i></p> <p>In June 1892, a thirty-year-old shoemaker named Homer Plessy bought a first-class railway ticket from his native New Orleans to Covington, north of Lake Pontchartrain. The two-hour trip had hardly begun when Plessy was arrested and removed from the train. Though Homer Plessy was born a free man of color and enjoyed relative equality while growing up in Reconstruction-era New Orleans, by 1890 he could no longer ride in the same carriage with white passengers. Plessy's act of civil disobedience was designed to test the constitutionality of the Separate Car Act, one of the many Jim Crow laws that threatened the freedoms gained by blacks after the Civil War. This largely forgotten case mandated separate-but-equal treatment and established segregation as the law of the land. It would be fifty-eight years before this ruling was reversed by Brown v. Board of Education. Keith Weldon Medley brings to life the players in this landmark trial, from the crusading black columnist Rodolphe Desdunes and the other members of the Comit� des Citoyens to Albion W. Tourgee, the outspoken writer who represented Plessy, to John Ferguson, a reformist carpetbagger who nonetheless felt that he had to judge Plessy guilty.</p></p><p><p>In 1896, Plessy v. Ferguson, Louisiana's famous Supreme Court case, established the separate-but-equal doctrine that prevailed in America until the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954. Homer Plessy's arrest in a New Orleans railway car was not mere happenstance, but the result of a carefully choreographed campaign of civil disobedience planned by the Comit� des Citoyens. This group of Republican free men of color had watched their rights disappear under the increasingly strict Jim Crow laws of the post-Reconstruction period. To contest these new restrictions, they arranged for Plessy, who could "pass" for white, to illegally seat himself in a whites-only carriage.</p><p>Keith Weldon Medley brings to life the players in this landmark trial, from the crusading black columnist Rodolphe Desdunes and the other members of the Comit� des Citoyens to Albion W.

The U.S. Supreme Court sustained the finding, with only John Marshall Harlan, a Southern associate justice, voting against the decision.</p><p>Keith Weldon Medley was born in New Orleans and grew up in the Faubourg Marigny, not far from where Homer Plessy lived. He attended St. Augustine High School and graduated from Southern University in New Orleans with a B.A. in sociology and psychology.

The bond that unites geomorphology with so many apparently diverse disciplines is the common need to understand the processes operating within the Earth's surficial systems. Thus, although the historical aspect of landscapes remains important, it is absolutely essential for earth scientists to have a basic understanding of surface mechanics.</p></p><p>Title of related interest also by Waveland Press: Bloom, Geomorphology: A Systematic Analysis of Late Cenozoic Landforms, Third Edition (ISBN 9781577663546).&#34;A great text with excellent detail.

Young, University of British Columbia</p><h2>Touching a Nerve: Our Brains, Our Selves</h2><p><p><strong>A trailblazing philosopher&#x2019;s exploration of the latest brain science&#x2015;and its ethical and practical implications.</strong></p> What happens when we accept that everything we feel and think stems not from an immaterial spirit but from electrical and chemical activity in our brains? In this thought-provoking narrative&#x2015;drawn from professional expertise as well as personal life experiences&#x2015;trailblazing neurophilosopher Patricia S. Churchland grounds the philosophy of mind in the essential ingredients of biology. She reflects with humor on how she came to harmonize science and philosophy, the mind and the brain, abstract ideals and daily life. <p>Offering lucid explanations of the neural workings that underlie identity, she reveals how the latest research into consciousness, memory, and free will can help us reexamine enduring philosophical, ethical, and spiritual questions: What shapes our personalities? How do we account for near-death experiences? How do we make decisions? And why do we feel empathy for others? Recent scientific discoveries also provide insights into a fascinating range of real-world dilemmas&#x2015;for example, whether an adolescent can be held responsible for his actions and whether a patient in a coma can be considered a self.</p><p>Churchland appreciates that the brain-based understanding of the mind can unnerve even our greatest thinkers. At a conference she attended, a prominent philosopher cried out, &#x201c;I hate the brain; I hate the brain!&#x201d; But as Churchland shows, he need not feel this way. Accepting that our brains are the basis of who we are liberates us from the shackles of superstition. It allows us to take ourselves seriously as a product of evolved mechanisms, past experiences, and social influences. And it gives us hope that we can fix some grievous conditions, and when we cannot, we can at least understand them with compassion.</p> 16 illustrations</p><p>Patricia Churchland is the author of, most recently, Conscience: The Origins of Moral Intuition and Touching a Nerve: Our Brains, Our Selves.

A terrific read!&#x201d;<br> - <strong>David Livingstone Smith, author of <em>Less than Human: Why We Demean, Enslave and Exterminate Others</em></strong></p><h2>Lolita</h2><p>This is the novel that first established Nabokov&#39;s reputation with a large audience tour-de-force of comic satire on sex and the American ways of life.</p><p>Despite its lascivious reputation, the pleasures of <i>Lolita</i> are as much intellectual as erogenous. It is a love story with the power to raise both chuckles and eyebrows. Humbert Humbert is a European intellectual adrift in America, haunted by memories of a lost adolescent love. When he meets his ideal nymphet in the shape of 12-year-old Dolores Haze, he constructs an elaborate plot to seduce her, but first he must get rid of her mother. In spite of his diabolical wit, reality proves to be more slippery than Humbert's feverish fantasies, and Lolita refuses to conform to his image of the perfect lover.<p> Playfully perverse in form as well as content, riddled with puns and literary allusions, Nabokov's 1955 novel is a hymn to the Russian-born author's delight in his adopted language. Indeed, readers who want to probe all of its allusive nooks and crannies will need to consult the annotated edition. <i>Lolita</i> is undoubtedly, brazenly erotic, but the eroticism springs less from the "frail honey-hued shoulders ... the silky supple bare back" of little Lo than it does from the wantonly gorgeous prose that Humbert uses to recount his forbidden passion: </p><blockquote> She was musical and apple-sweet ... Lola the bobby-soxer, devouring her immemorial fruit, singing through its juice ... and every movement she made, every shuffle and ripple, helped me to conceal and to improve the secret system of tactile correspondence between beast and beauty--between my gagged, bursting beast and the beauty of her dimpled body in its innocent cotton frock. </blockquote> Much has been made of <i>Lolita</i> as metaphor, perhaps because the love affair at its heart is so troubling. Humbert represents the formal, educated Old World of Europe, while Lolita is America: ripening, beautiful, but not too bright and a little vulgar. Nabokov delights in exploring the intercourse between these cultures, and the passages where Humbert describes the suburbs and strip malls and motels of postwar America are filled with both attraction and repulsion, "those restaurants where the holy spirit of Huncan Dines had descended upon the cute paper napkins and cottage-cheese-crested salads." Yet however tempting the novel's symbolism may be, its chief delight--and power--lies in the character of Humbert Humbert. He, at least as he tells it, is no seedy skulker, no twisted destroyer of innocence. Instead, Nabokov's celebrated mouthpiece is erudite and witty, even at his most depraved. Humbert can't help it--linguistic <i>jouissance</i> is as important to him as the satisfaction of his arrested libido. <i>--Simon Leake</i>Critics are just beginning to hail Jeremy Irons' performance for Random House AudioBooks...<p><b>"a road trip to hell in a luxury sedan." </b><br>--Salon Magazine</p><p><b>"In his reading Irons recreates the clarity, precision, and lilt of every glorious sentence." </b><br>--The Washington Post</p><p><b>"Nabokov said Lolita was the record of his love affair with the English language; Irons makes it a menage a trois." </b><br>-- Vogue</p><p><b>"[Irons's] efforts have placed this superb audio on my life list, to be saved for repeated listening."</b><br>--Boston Globe</p><p>" . . . most praiseworthy of all the audio efforts I've heard . . ."<br>-- Men's Journal</p><p><b>"Irons' inspired reading is not to be missed."</b><br> -- Chicago Tribune</p><p><b>"...a beautifully produced recording that pushes the boundaries of the audio medium.<br> . . . hands down the best audio production of the year." </b><br>-- Library Journal</p><p><b>"Irons reads with wickedly understated malevolence, preserving Humbert's foolish patrician airs.

Jay Parini spent over twenty years interviewing friends of Robert Frost and working in the poet&#39;s archives at Dartmouth, Amherst, and elsewhere to produce this definitive and insightful biography of both the public and private man. While he depicts the various stages of Frost&#39;s colorful life, Parini also sensitively explores the poet&#39;s psyche, showing how he dealt with adversity, family tragedy, and depression. By taking the reader into the poetry itself, which he reads closely and brilliantly, Parini offers an insightful road map to Frost&#39;s remarkable world.</p><p>Robert Frost, the farmer-poet of New England, actually spent his formative early years in San Francisco. His mother moved the family east after the death of her husband--a hard-living journalist from whom Robert took his willful perversity. He attended Dartmouth and Harvard, leaving both prematurely, and after putative stabs at teaching and journalism became a poultry farmer in New Hampshire. It took a trip to England in 1912 (to live "under thatch") for his poetry finally to be published, and when he returned to America in 1915 his reputation had preceded him. Until his death in 1963, he worked assiduously at consolidating his position as America's premier voice; reading at Kennedy's inauguration and meeting Khrushchev were just two of the scenes he stole. So why does Jay Parini need to reclaim him?<p> The answer lies with Lawrance Thompson. Thompson was one of Frost's most earnest disciples, and for years the poet, ever eager to shape his own image, allowed him a Boswellian intimacy. Unfortunately, Thompson came to despise his former mentor, and his exhaustively documented volumes portray Frost as a kind of solipsistic monster, in marked contrast to the awe with which he had previously been described. Parini, also a biographer of John Steinbeck, in a wave of perspective seeks a corrective to Thompson's bile. His writing is intelligent yet breathlessly generous, and he is at his best when considering the poems themselves. He rightly ascribes to Frost the innovation of the colloquial voice in serious verse--a legacy that appears immense today when so much contemporary poetry consists of little else. Frost's mastery lay in the freedom he found within conformity and the dark corners he discovered by probing, which contribute to a melancholic spirituality beyond the rusticity for which he is popularly celebrated. While Thompson's egg is cracked and dry, Parini prefers a softer boil, and his elegantly reverential tone is imbued with a perception that reminds readers how great a poet Frost remains. The clergyman who advised him at an early age that his verse was "too close to speech," and thus gave him his voice, deserves eternal gratitude. <i>--David Vincent, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><p><b>Jay Parini</b>, a poet, novelist, and biographer, is Axinn Professor of English at Middlebury College.

The dictionary contains maps, charts, and illustrations to further clarify the written material.&nbsp;The biblical text used is the NRSV translation. <br> <br> A diverse group of 900 scholars from 40 countries have contributed 7100 fresh new articles with 8400 entries including persons, places, things, theological concepts, and much more. These contributors were selected by the editorial board for their expertise in their field and for the quality of their scholarship in publication. Special care was taken to select authors who could provide a variety of perspectives from different theological traditions (Protestant, Catholic, Jewish), diverse theological trajectory (conservative and liberal), and from the social locations of gender, ethnicity, and race.&nbsp;<br> <br> Topics are listed in alphabetical order from A-Z and evenly divided among the five volumes. The main entry (in bold) includes a pronunciation guide. Hebrew and Greek origins of the entry follow, with transliteration. Longer articles contain an introduction that summarizes the topic and include a helpful outline to guide the reader. Articles conclude with a short bibliography and cross references to related articles. In each definition, authors strive to incorporate as many biblical instances of the term as possible in the given amount of space, and to discuss the theological, social, or ecclesial implications of the topic, so that the definitions are practical aids to the tasks of preaching, teaching, and study of the Bible.<br> <br> Volume Structure;<br> 1.

Jim Harnish</p><h2>Taken at the Flood: The Roman Conquest of Greece (Ancient Warfare and Civilization)</h2><p><em>"Is there anyone on earth who is so narrow-minded or uninquisitive that he could fail to want to know how and thanks to what kind of political system almost the entire known world was conquered and brought under a single empire in less than fifty-three years?" --Polybius, </em>Histories<br><br>The 53-year period Polybius had in mind stretched from the start of the Second Punic War in 219 BCE until 167, when Rome overthrew the Macedonian monarchy and divided the country into four independent republics. This was the crucial half-century of Rome's spectacular rise to imperial status, but Roman interest in its eastern neighbors began a little earlier, with the First Illyrian War of 229, and climaxed later with the infamous destruction of Corinth in 146. <br><br><em>Taken at the Flood</em> chronicles this momentous move by Rome into the Greek east. Until now, this period of history has been overshadowed by the threat of Carthage in the west, but events in the east were no less important in themselves, and Robin Waterfield's account reveals the peculiar nature of Rome's eastern policy. For over seventy years, the Romans avoided annexation so that they could commit their military and financial resources to the fight against Carthage and elsewhere. Though ultimately a failure, this policy of indirect rule, punctuated by periodic brutal military interventions and intense diplomacy, worked well for several decades, until the Senate finally settled on more direct forms of control. <br><br>Waterfield's fast-paced narrative focuses mainly on military and diplomatic maneuvers, but throughout he interweaves other topics and themes, such as the influence of Greek culture on Rome, the Roman aristocratic ethos, and the clash between the two best fighting machines the ancient world ever produced: the Macedonian phalanx and Roman legion. The result is an absorbing account of a critical chapter in Rome's mastery of the Mediterranean.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robin Waterfield </strong>is an independent scholar, living in southern Greece. In addition to more than 25 translations of works of Greek literature, he is the author of numerous books, most recently<em> Dividing the Spoils: The War for Alexander the Great's Empire</em>.<br><br>"Waterfield has made himself into a living international treasure by his lean and lucid accounts of some of the most involved periods of ancient history (here, Rome's wars in Greece and Macedonia; in <em>Dividing the Spoils</em>, the wars of Alexander the Great's successors). The current story Waterfield tells clearly and enjoyably, with a deft selection of detail." --J.E. Lendon, <em>The Weekly Standard</em><p></p><br>"The story Waterfield tells is complex, but he tells it well." --Peter Jones, <em>BBC History</em><p></p><br>"This sorry story is told with great verve and pace by Waterfield." --<em>Literary Review</em><p></p><br>"<em>Taken at the Flood</em> is a thrilling account of the bloody process that created Greco-Roman civilization. It is also a masterpiece of ancient history. Much has been written about the march of Roman arms, but for some reason scholars have never gotten around to producing a comprehensive volume of Rome's most crucial conquest--Greece. This has filled that void, in what will long remain the definitive account of Rome's subjugation of the once powerful Greek states." --Jim Lacey, author of <em>The First Clash: The Miraculous Greek Victory at Marathon and Its Impact on Western Civilization</em> and <em>Moment of Battle: The Twenty Clashes That Changed the World</em><p></p><br>"<em>Taken at the Flood</em> is as elegant and powerful an introduction to the Roman conquest of Greece as you are likely to find. Waterfield tells the story in all its blood and cunning." --Barry Strauss, author of <em>Masters of Command: Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar and the Genius of Leadership</em><p></p><br>"<em>Taken at the Flood</em> offers a vivid and exciting retelling of a key chapter in the story of Rome's rise to power, the conquest of the Greeks." --Greg Woolf, Professor of Ancient History at the University of St Andrews and author of <em>Rome: An Empire's Story</em><p></p><br>"An epic tale, engagingly told in clear, eloquent prose. ...

She wrote more than twenty novels, and twenty-five books of poems and journals. <br><br>The acclaimed biographer Margot Peters was given full access to Sarton's letters, journals, and notes, and during five years of research came to know Sarton herself--the complex woman and artist. She gives us a compelling portrait of Sarton the actress, the poet, the novelist, the feminist, the writer who struggled for literary acceptance. She shows us, beneath Sarton's exhilarating, irresistible spirit, the needy courtier and seducer, the woman whose creativity was propelled by the psychic drama she created in others.<br><br>We watch young May at age two as she is abruptly uprooted from her native Belgium by World War I, a child ignored both by her mother, who was intent on her own artistic vision and reluctant to cope with a child, and by her father, obsessed with his academic research.<br><br>We see Sarton as a young girl in America, and then later, at nineteen, choosing a life in the theatre, landing a job in Eva Le Gallienne's Civic Repertory, and gathering what would become a tight-knit coterie of friends and lovers . . . Sarton beginning to write poetry and novels . . . Sarton making friends with Elizabeth Bowen and Julian Huxley, Erika and Klaus Mann, Virginia Woolf, the poet H.D.--charming and enlisting them with her work, her vitality, her hunger for&nbsp;&nbsp;love, driven by her need to conquer (among her conquests: Bowen, Huxley, and later his wife, Juliette). <br><br>We see her intense friendships with literary pals, including Muriel Rukeyser (her lover), and Louise Bogan, Sarton's "literary sibling,&nbsp;&nbsp;who at once encouraged her and excluded her from a world in which Bogan was a central figure. <br><br>We see Sarton begin to create in the spiritual journals that inspired the devotion of readers the image of a strong, independent woman who lived peacefully with solitude--an image that contradicted the reality of her neediness, loneliness, and isolation as she pushed away loved ones with her demands and betrayals.<br><br>A fascinating portrait of one of our major literary figures--a book that for the first time reveals the life that she herself kept hidden.</p><p>Margot Peters had full access to May Sarton&#39;s letters, journals, and notes while she researched and wrote this biography, and the result is a book that charts Sarton&#39;s personal life as it explores her work as a poet, novelist, and feminist. Peters carefully details Sarton&#39;s many love affairs (mostly with women), portraying the writer as an insensitive and self-absorbed lover who was prone to betrayal on the slightest pretext. She attributes this behavior to Sarton&#39;s precarious sense of self-worth, developed as a result of parental neglect in her early childhood. That low self-esteem resonated in Sarton&#39;s incessant fear--despite publishing 15 books of poetry, 19 novels, and 13 memoirs and journals--that her writing might not be quite up to par. Peters draws this out and, unlike many literary biographers, allows that her subject&#39;s writing could have been better. Throughout the book, she points to Sarton&#39;s common use of clich� and her tendency toward sentimentality. She suggests that if Sarton had taken more care with her craft and had better editors to guide her, she might have evolved into a better writer. Ultimately, the blend of facts about Sarton&#39;s life and loves with the critical analysis of her writing gives readers a comprehensive view of this complex woman and artist."Engrossing . . .

While much has been written about the concept of terroir as it relates to wine, in this vibrant, personal book, Amy Trubek, a pioneering voice in the new culinary revolution, expands the concept of terroir beyond wine and into cuisine and culture more broadly. Bringing together lively stories of people farming, cooking, and eating, she focuses on a series of examples ranging from shagbark hickory nuts in Wisconsin and maple syrup in Vermont to wines from northern California. She explains how the complex concepts of terroir and <i>go�t de terroir </i>are instrumental to France's food and wine culture and then explores the multifaceted connections between taste and place in both cuisine and agriculture in the United States. How can we reclaim the taste of place, and what can it mean for us in a country where, on average, any food has traveled at least fifteen hundred miles from farm to table? Written for anyone interested in food, this book shows how the taste of place matters now, and how it can mediate between our local desires and our global reality to define and challenge American food practices.</p><p>"<i>The Taste of Place</i> provides a delightful and informed read, through the stories and analysis of people and places across the country, of terroir as dynamic; possessing a European-like food ethos but adapting to the American landscape."&#x2015;Michael W. Hamm, C.S. Mott Professor of Sustainable Agriculture, Michigan State University<br><br>"This volume introduces a new and powerful idea into the quickly expanding American literature of food. Amy Trubek is better qualified than anyone I know to offer an American take on terroir&#x2015;her background as an anthropologist, a chef, an orchardist, and an activist in the local food movement let her understand the idea of taste in all its diverse and wonderful dimensions, and her skill as a writer lets her communicate with great grace what she's figured out!"&#x2015;Bill McKibben, author of <i>Deep Economy: The Wealth of Communities and the Durable Future</i><br><br>"Anyone concerned with the future of food in America should read this acutely perceptive, engagingly written, and, above all, compelling inquiry into the relationship between the taste of food and where it comes from. It is a delight, as well as a revelation, to travel with Amy Trubek as she criss-crosses America and the French countryside, talking to growers, distributors, vintners, chefs, farmers, scientists, and activists&#x2015;to the women and men committed to making taste connections matter.

Indeed, he provides a complete overview of this remarkable find, ranging from an informative, basic discussion of the origins of life and animals on earth, to a colorful description of Charles Walcott's discovery of the Burgess Shale and of the painstaking scientific work that went on there (as well as in Burgess collections held at Harvard and the Smithsonian), to an account of similar fossil finds in Greenland and in China. The heart of the book is an imaginative trip in a time machine, back to the Cambrian seas, where the reader sees first-hand the remarkable diversity of life as it existed then. And perhaps most important, Conway Morris examines the lessons to be learned from the Burgess Shale, especially as they apply to modern evolutionary thinking. In particular, he critiques the ideas of Stephen Jay Gould, whose best-selling book <em>Wonderful Life</em> drew on Conway Morris's Burgess Shale work. The author takes a fresh look at the evidence and draws quite different conclusions from Gould on the nature of evolution. <br> This finely illustrated volume takes the reader to the forefront of paleontology as it provides fresh insights into the nature of evolution and of life on earth.</p><p>The Burgess Shale deposits, in western Canada, have joined the Galapagos Islands as a destination of choice for vacationing scientists and fans of evolutionary theory. The fame of these places is in part due to the unique flora and fauna (living or dead) they boast, and in part to the scientists who have described and attempted to explain them. Like Stephen J. Gould's <i>Wonderful Life</i>, this book from Simon Conway Morris, original describer of the fascinating, troubling fossil <i>Hallucigenia</i>, gives an account of the Burgess Shale and the scientists who argue over the tiny remains of once-living creatures. Conway Morris calls the place "the most wonderful fossil deposit in the world," and his emotion is contagious. Beyond describing the creatures that formed the fossils, he speculates about how the Burgess Shale fits in to the story of human evolution.<br><strong>Simon Conway Morris</strong> is Professor of Paleontology in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Cambridge, England, and is a Fellow of the Royal Society. He lives in Cambridge.<br></p><h2>The History of Japanese Photography</h2><p>Over the past 150 years, Japanese photographers have created an impressive body of work that ranges from dignified imperial portraits to sweeping urban panoramas, from early ethereal landscapes to modern urban mysteries. Despite the richness, significance, and variety of this work, however, it has largely been neglected in Western histories of photography. This gorgeous and groundbreaking book - the first comprehensive account of Japanese photography from its inception in the mid-nineteenth century to the present day - reveals to English-speaking audiences the importance and beauty of this art form.</p><p>Except for the rare international superstar like Araki Nobuyoshi, known for his gamy shots of nude young women, Japanese photography is a closed book to Westerners. Yet it has a distinguished and vital tradition that has enriched every genre, from portraits to landscapes, with a unique blend of lyricism and candor. In <i>The History of Japanese Photography</i>, a wealth of captivating images and essays by seven scholars trace 140 years of stylistic and cultural evolution. In 1857 a local ruler had his portrait taken with a daguerreotype set brought to Nagasaki by a foreign ship. Eleven years later, official photographs of the emperor--never glimpsed in person by his subjects&#x2014;became widely available. Photographers were increasingly called upon to document new Japanese territories, natural disasters, and wars. Visitors hankered after studio shots of geishas and other exotica. Beginning in the 1890s, upper-class amateur photographers contributed a new emphasis on aesthetics. In the 1930s exquisite Pictorialist images of natural beauty gave way to modernist influences from Berlin and Moscow, and then&#x2014;in wartime&#x2014;to a conservative emphasis on traditional rural life. Individual expression dominated postwar photography, as seen in such images as Tomatsu Shomei&#x2019;s haunting "Beer bottle after the atomic bomb explosion." Recent work reflects the dislocations of urban consumer society. Beautifully produced, with 356 color illustrations, this groundbreaking volume accompanies an exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (March 2-April 27, 2003) that travels to the Cleveland Museum of Art (May 18-July 27, 2003). <i>&#x2014;Cathy Curtis<i></i></i>This book accompanies an important exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (March 2-April 27, 2003), which will then travel to the Cleveland Museum of Art (May 18-July 27, 2003).

Sunday Times</p>Brian Moore burst upon the literary scene in 1955 with this moving and brilliantly observed study of a woman imprisoned by the passage of time. He went on to be hailed as one of the best fiction writers of his generation.<br><br>Alone in her room in a Belfast boarding house, Judith Hearne is almost overwhelmed by loneliness. Yet she still believes there is a chance for happiness, and she waits patiently for the moment when her life will turn from sorrowful longing to joy. By chance she meets a man ? the man ? and her dreams take on a brighter hue, only to be dashed once more.<br><br>With skill and gentle insight, Moore depicts the disintegration of Judith Hearne?s last illusions. Clinging to the bottle for comfort, she becomes a tragic figure who speaks frankly about the human condition. Though we laugh at her foibles, we weep at her plight, and share her primal longing for love and connection.<br><br>This touching story was made into a critically acclaimed motion picture in 1987.</p><h2>Basic Statistics for Business and Economics</h2><p>Basic Statistics for Business and Economics, Ninth Edition provides an introductory survey of descriptive and inferential statistics, using clear and succinct writing.

Wilde&#39;s supremely witty tale of dandies, anarchists and a murderous prophecy in London high society. Introducing Little Black Classics: 80 books for Penguin&#39;s 80th birthday. Little Black Classics celebrate the huge range and diversity of Penguin Classics, with books from around the world and across many centuries. They take us from a balloon ride over Victorian London to a garden of blossom in Japan, from Tierra del Fuego to 16th-century California and the Russian steppe. Here are stories lyrical and savage; poems epic and intimate; essays satirical and inspirational; and ideas that have shaped the lives of millions. Oscar Wilde (1854-1900). Wilde&#39;s works available in Penguin Classics are De Profundis and Other Prison Writings, The Complete Short Fiction, The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays, The Picture of Dorian Gray and The Soul of Man Under Socialism and Selected Critical Prose.Oscar Fingal O&#39;Flahertie Wills Wilde was born in Dublin in 1854. He went to Trinity College, Dublin and then to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he began to propagandize the new Aesthetic (or &#39;Art for Art&#39;s Sake&#39;) Movement. Despite winning a first and the Newdigate Prize for Poetry, Wilde failed to obtain an Oxford scholarship, and was forced to earn a living by lecturing and writing for periodicals. After his marriage to Constance Lloyd in 1884, he tried to establish himself as a writer, but with little initial success. However, his three volumes of short fiction, The Happy Prince (1888), Lord Arthur Savile&#39;s Crime (1891) and A House of Pomegranates (1891), together with his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891), gradually won him a reputation as a modern writer with an original talent, a reputation confirmed and enhanced by the phenomenal success of his Society Comedies - Lady Windermere&#39;s Fan, A Woman of No Importance, An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest, all performed on the West End stage between 1892 and 1895. Success, however, was short-lived. In 1891 Wilde had met and fallen extravagantly in love with Lord Alfred Douglas. In 1895, when his success as a dramatist was at its height, Wilde brought an unsuccessful libel action against Douglas&#39;s father, the Marquess of Queensberry. Wilde lost the case and two trials later was sentenced to two years&#39; imprisonment for acts of gross indecency. As a result of this experience he wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol. He was released from prison in 1897 and went into an immediate self-imposed exile on the Continent. He died in Paris in ignominy in 1900.</p><h2>Watermark (Asian American Writers Worksh)</h2><p>This landmark collection of poetry and prose heralds a new era for Vietnamese American literature. Here, for the first time, the most innovative contemporary Vietnamese American writers explore thematic and stylistic territory previously overlooked in other collections, which have traditionally focused on the all-too-expected theme of war. With works by such writers as Linh Dinh, Andrew Lam and Christian Langworthy.</p><p>This landmark collection of poetry and prose heralds a new era for Vietnamese- American literature"Watermark is simply some of the best writing from a new generation of Vietnamese writers in America. Eloquent, poignant, funny-the writing goes beyond war-taking us into the towns and fields of America. This is the Vietnamese literature of the future, 'a taste of the pure, sea salt sadness of the outcast' (to paraphrase Monique T.D. Truong) made inclusive by the editors' uncommon and judicious selections." &#x2014;Russell Leong, Editor, UCLA Amerasia Journal <p>"Vietnamese-American literature is young. You can hardly tell it, though, from this collection of stories published by the Asian American Writers' Workshop in New York. Here is an array of diverse talents that surprise and delight. Keen observation or exuberant fancy. Gentle humor, urbane charm, or devilish wit. Real life or the magic of dreams. Read Watermark and treat yourself to some fiction that transcends mere documents of the Vietnamese-American experience." &#x2014;Huynh Sanh Thong, Publisher and General Editor, The Vietnam Review</p></p><h2>Proust: The Search (Jewish Lives)</h2><p><b>From the prizewinning Jewish Lives series, an arresting new study of the life, times, and achievement of one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century</b><br><br> &#x201c;Taylor&#x2019;s endeavor is not to explain the life by the novel or the novel by the life but to show how different events, different emotional upheavals, fired Proust&#x2019;s imagination and, albeit sometimes completely transformed, appeared in his work. The result is a very subtle, thought-provoking book.&#x201d;&#x2014;Anka Muhlstein, author of <i>Balzac&#x2019;s Omelette</i> and <i>Monsieur Proust&#x2019;s Library</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Marcel Proust came into his own as a novelist comparatively late in life, yet only Shakespeare, Balzac, Dickens, Tolstoy, and Dostoyevsky were his equals when it came to creating characters as memorably human. As biographer Benjamin Taylor suggests, Proust was a literary lightweight before writing his multivolume masterwork <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>, but following a series of momentous historical and personal events, he became&#x2014;against all expectations&#x2014;one of the greatest writers of his, and indeed any, era.<br> &nbsp;<br> This insightful, beautifully written biography examines Proust&#x2019;s artistic struggles&#x2014;the &#x201c;search&#x201d; of the subtitle&#x2014;and stunning metamorphosis in the context of his times. Taylor provides an in-depth study of the author&#x2019;s life while exploring how Proust&#x2019;s personal correspondence and published works were greatly informed by his mother&#x2019;s Judaism, his homosexuality, and such dramatic events as the Dreyfus Affair and, above all, World War I. As Taylor writes in his prologue, &#x201c;Proust&#x2019;s <i>Search</i> is the most encyclopedic of novels, encompassing the essentials of human nature. . . . His account, running from the early years of the Third Republic to the aftermath of World War I, becomes the inclusive story of all lives, a colossal mimesis. To read the entire <i>Search</i> is to find oneself transfigured and victorious at journey&#x2019;s end, at home in time and in eternity too.&#x201d;<br><br><b>About Jewish Lives:&nbsp;</b><br><br> Jewish Lives is a prizewinning series of interpretative biography designed to explore the many facets of Jewish identity. Individual volumes illuminate the imprint of Jewish figures upon literature, religion, philosophy, politics, cultural and economic life, and the arts and sciences. Subjects are paired with authors to elicit lively, deeply informed books that explore the range and depth of the Jewish experience from antiquity to the present.<br><br> In 2014, the Jewish Book Council named Jewish Lives the winner of its Jewish Book of the Year Award, the first series ever to receive this award.<br><br><b>More praise for Jewish Lives:</b><br><br> "Excellent."&nbsp;&#x2013;New York Times<br><br> "Exemplary."&nbsp;&#x2013;Wall Street Journal<br><br> "Distinguished."&nbsp;&#x2013;New Yorker<br><br> "Superb."&nbsp;&#x2013;The Guardian</p><p><b>Benjamin Taylor</b> is a founding member of the Graduate Writing Program faculty at the New School and the author or editor of six previous books, including <i>The Book of Getting Even</i> and <i>Saul Bellow: Letters</i><i>.</i>"This engaging book, invitingly elegant to handle with it&#x2019;s beautiful deckle-edged pages, should encourage those who have quailed at the thought of Proust&#x2019;s colossus to have another go."&#x2014;John Carey, <i>Sunday Times</i><br>"Benjamin Taylor&#x2019;s <i>Proust: The Search</i> is a marvel of brief biography, reanimating the hapless, almost Chaplinesque figure who by all logic should never have accomplished what he did. With a kind of worldly tenderness, Taylor shows Proust&#x2019;s work accruing amid personal pratfalls, French anti-Semitism and the catastrophe of World War I."&#x2014;Thomas Mallon, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br>"Taylor&#x2019;s loose, multi-clausal sentences are as bendy as the master&#x2019;s, and there is the same shimmery quality to the prose, like sunlight glancing off a shallow Normandy sea."&#x2014;Kathryn Hughes, <i>Guardian</i><br>"An important contribution to the study of this complex individual . . . A riveting summary of the rampant anti-Semitism found in late 19th-century France . . . . Excellent analysis of the Dreyfus affair and how it split French society . . . . A noteworthy biography of a great writer."&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i><br>"A sensitive study of literature's favorite neurasthenic. . . . Readers of Proust will be fascinated to find clues as to who his characters were in real life, and they should be moved to appreciation by Taylor's assessment of Proust's accomplishment . . . A densely packed and rewarding book."&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br>"Taylor expertly deconstructs where the similarities between Proust's fictional self and real-life self begin and end . . . . A deep analysis of Proust's masterpiece and a biography of Proust the man, Taylor proves, are one and the same."&#x2014;<i>Shelf Awareness</i><br>"Those who found reading Proust too grand an undertaking over the years because of distractions and deficiencies of their own, might well rush to reconsider after confronting this dazzlingly elegant biography."&#x2014;Philip Roth<br>"Taylor&#x2019;s endeavor is not to explain the life by the novel or the novel by the life but to show how different events, different emotional upheavals, fired Proust&#x2019;s imagination and, albeit sometimes completely transformed, appeared in his work. The result is a very subtle, thought-provoking book."&#x2014;Anka Muhlstein, author of <i>Balzac&#x2019;s Omelette </i>and<i> Monsieur Proust&#x2019;s Library</i><br></p><h2>Site Planning, 2nd Edition</h2><p>The highly successful first edition of <i>Site Planning</i> was greeted by reviewers as "a most unusual type of book, in which the most practical and detailed advice is given in terms readily absorbed by beginners, though it is written by a leading theoretician concerning 'the image of the city'" <i>(Architectural Forum)</i>...and as meriting a "prominent place on the bookshelves of all us actively concerned with achieving true quality in our changing environment" <i>(Landscape)</i>.<br> <br> Over one hundred pages longer than the 1962 version, this second edition of <i>Site Planning</i> is a completely revised and updated source of information on the art of arranging the external physical environment in all its detail. Much new material has been added, particularly in respect to ecology, psychosocial analyses, and design methods. The number of illustrations has grown, and the use of margins as a cross-reference system has been amplified. Perhaps the most important aspect&#x2014;the original idea of environmental design as a continuous process involving many participants&#x2014;has been more completely and systematically developed.<br> <br> The art of site planning is comprehensively covered by chapters on analyzing a locality, organizing place and action, movement systems, "sensuous form," problems of control, and design and management of the site. These are interspersed by technical chapters on site form and ecology, social and psychological analyses, streets and ways, earthwork and utilities, design methods, and costs. Discussions of housing and of special types of site planning (shopping centers and commercial strips, industrial districts, institutions, open space, and renewal) conclude the study.</p><p>Kevin Lynch (1918-1984) studied with Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin and later obtained a Bachelor of City Planning degree from MIT. After a long and distinguished career on the faculty of the MIT School of Architecture and Urban Planning, he was named Professor Emeritus of City Planning.<p>Whether he is discussing esthetics or pipe sizes, Lynch's writing, conditioned by experience with students, is remarkably clear; but because he is dealing with visual form and spatial relationships, he reassures the reader with hundreds of lucid thumbnail sketches in the margins beside the text; the effect is not unlike an animated film accompaniment.

The con artist assumes numerous identities &#x2014; a disabled beggar, a charity fundraiser, a successful businessman, an urbane gentleman &#x2014; to win over his not-entirely-innocent dupes. The central character's shifting identities, as fluid as the river itself, reflect broader aspects of human identity even as his impudent hoaxes form a meditation on illusion and trust. <br>This comic allegory addresses themes of sincerity, character, and morality in its challenge to the optimism and materialism of mid-19th-century America.

Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.<br><br>Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly of Emma. Between them it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by her own.<br><br>The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of herself: these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her.<br><br>Sorrow came-a gentle sorrow-but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness. Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor's loss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance. The wedding over, and the bride people gone, her father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening. Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost.<br><br>The event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her. The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her past kindness-the kindness, the affection of sixteen years-how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old-how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health-and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella's marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed; intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of hers; one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault.<br><br>How was she to bear the change? It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her. He could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.<br><br>The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits; for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.<br><br>Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily reach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house, and give her pleasant society again.<br><br>Highbury, the large and populous village almost amounting to a town, to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and name, did really belong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses were first in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many acquaintances in the place, for her father was universally civil, but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of everybody that he was used to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind. Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner:<br><br>"Poor Miss Taylor! I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!"<br><br>"I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a good wife; and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever, and bear all my odd humours,1 when she might have a house of her own?"<br><br>"A house of her own! but where is the advantage of a house of her own? This is three times as large; and you have never any odd humours, my dear."<br><br>"How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us! We shall be always meeting! We must begin; we must go and pay our wedding-visit very soon."<br><br>"My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could not walk half so far."<br><br>"No, papa; nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage, to be sure."<br><br>"The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way; and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit?"<br><br>"They are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa. You know we have settled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last night. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there. I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing, papa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her-James is so obliged to you!"<br><br>"I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am sure she will make a very good servant; she is a civil, pretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure she will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see. Whenever James goes over to his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us. He will be able to tell her how we all are."<br><br>Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably through the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. The backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary.<br><br>Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband. He lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their mutual connections in London. He had returned to a late dinner after some days' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did him good; and his many inquiries after "poor Isabella" and her children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr. Woodhouse gratefully observed:<br><br>"It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk."<br><br>"Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire."<br><br>"But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not catch cold."<br><br>"Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them."<br><br>"Well: that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain here. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding."<br><br>"By the bye, I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you all behave? Who cried most?"<br><br>"Ah! poor Miss Taylor! 'tis a sad business."<br><br>"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say 'poor Miss Taylor.' I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence! at any rate, it must be better to have only one to please than two."<br><br>"Especially when one of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!" said Emma playfully. "That is what you have in your head, I know-and what you would certainly say if my father were not by."<br><br>"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed," said Mr. Woodhouse, with a sigh. "I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome."<br><br>"My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean you, or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean you. What a horrible idea! Oh, no! I meant only myself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know-in a joke-it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another."<br><br>Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them; and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew it would be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by everybody.<br><br>"Emma knows I never flatter her," said Mr. Knightley, "but I meant no reflection on anybody. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be a gainer."<br><br>"Well," said Emma, willing to let it pass, "you want to hear about the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved charmingly. Everybody was punctual, everybody in their best looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh, no; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting every day."<br><br>"Dear Emma bears everything so well," said her father. "But, Mr. Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for."<br><br>Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles.<br><br>"It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion," said Mr. Knightley. "We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could suppose it: but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor's advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor's time of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married."<br><br>"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me," said Emma, "and a very considerable one-that I made the match myself. I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may comfort me for anything."<br><br>Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, "Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for whatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more matches."</p><h2>Disaster Mental Health: Theory and Practice (Crisis Intervention)</h2><p>Prepare for disaster with DISASTER MENTAL HEALTH: THEORY AND PRACTICE!

It can have a profound effect on virtually every aspect of life, causing depression, relationship problems, and even physical illness. <i>Healing From Family Rifts </i>offers hope to those coping with a split in their families. Family therapist Mark Sichel addresses the pain and shame connected with family rifts and offers a way through the crisis and on toward healing and fulfillment. Uniquely, Sichel does not assume that every rift will or even should be mended. Instead, he offers ways to recover from any outcome, including:</p> <ul> <li>A 10-step process to come to terms with the family dynamics that led to the split </li><li>Methods to find peace and personal reconciliation </li><li>Skills that help to build a second family of people whose values are in line with one's own </li><li>Techniques to fight feelings of guilt when faced with a family rift </li><li>Includes inspiring and instructive stories drawn from the author's patients that help readers put their own situations in perspective. </li></ul></p><p><p><b>Make peace with yourself and reclaim your life with Mark Sichel's powerful ten-step healing program</b></p> <p>"That's it.

But now you're left with the nagging despair of losing a family member. The pain can be overwhelming, but there is a way out. Through the help of Healing from Family Rifts,<i> </i>you can find peace again and recover from the<i> </i>isolation of family exile.</p> <p>Author and licensed clinical social worker Mark Sichel knows what it's like to suffer a family exile: his parents cut off all communication with him years ago. Now he's applying the steps used during his own recovery to help you overcome the heartbreak of your family rift. Through his powerful and proven ten-step program, along with the stories of other embattled survivors of family wars, you will achieve real, permanent, inner reconciliation, regardless of the cause of the rift--whether divorce, marriage outside your race or religion, emotional abuse, objections to sexual orientation, addictions, or any other reason.</p> <p>From dealing with the shock of the rift to building your second-chance family, from recognizing the signs of acute stress disorder to learning from successful families, Mark Sichel's ten steps to healing will help you achieve serenity and contentment by learning how to make peace with yourself first<i>.</i></p> <p><b>Review from <i>Library Journal</i></b></p> <p>[This] self-help manual for adults seeking to better their family relationships emphasizes that readers can change only themselves and their own reactions-not the actions of others.

Among other strategies, his ten steps lead readers to deal with their own trauma, learn to love themselves, understand family myths and roles, build supportive relationships with others (their "second-chance family"), and try to heal the break if possible.

When this art was rediscovered in the Renaissance, hermetic thinkers like Giordano Bruno reworked it into a method that allowed them to acquire knowledge with the creation of &#x201c;memory palaces.&#x201d; The elements of these memory palaces were not intended to trigger the memory but would actually transform into talismanic objects with knowledge entirely new to the seeker. <br><br>In this book, Charles B. Jameux shows that this hermetic reworking of the classical art of memory was no mystery to operative Masons, who grafted it onto their own rituals, catalyzing the transformation of operative Masonry into speculative Masonry. He shows how the hieroglyphic writing used during the Renaissance in the art of memory provided the groundwork for one of the most esoteric elements of masonic practice: the grasp of the realm of image by the letter, where symbols were &#x201c;buried&#x201d; within words. Using archival evidence from 17th-century Scotland and earlier, combined with the research of modern scholars such as Frances Yates and David Stevenson, Jameux argues that the creation of speculative Freemasonry can be traced back 100 years earlier than conventional history records--to 1637, when the first recorded use of the Mason&#x2019;s Word appeared and with it, the first known appearance of the symbolic Temple of Solomon. He follows Giordano Bruno&#x2019;s visit to the British Isles in the late 16th century and the subsequent activities of the men he met there, showing that Masonic symbolism owes much of its current form to early memory palaces, which represented the Masonic lodge and temple in their fully imaginary states. <br><br>Revealing the pivotal role of the memory palace and hermetic traditions in early Masonic symbolism, Jameux sheds new light on the Masonic questions asked of each initiate and the spiritual importance of the Temple of Jerusalem to Freemasonry.</p><p>Charles B. Jameux was Grand Chancellor of Foreign Relations of the Grand Lodge of France and the chief editor of the Masonic Journal of the Grand Lodge of France, <i>Initiatory Perspectives</i>, from 1998 to 2001. He is currently the director of the Living Stone collection for the French publisher Dervy (Tredaniel Group). He lives in France.<b>Chapter Two</b> <br><br>&#x201c;To think is to reflect on images.&#x201d; <br><br>--Giordano Bruno <br><br>In the seventeenth century, the extraordinary mnemonic technique, &#x201c;the art of memory,&#x201d; which straddles both analogical thinking and conceptual thought, did not enjoy quite the popularity and efflorescence it had, paradoxically, among those who know how to read and write in Antiquity, as well as during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. <br><br>In Antiquity, under the impetus of the first treatises of the <i>Ad Herenium</i> and of Cicero, this art was mainly envisioned for the use of orators. As David Stevenson says in<i> The Origins of Freemasonry</i>, &#x201c;The art of memory was a technique for improving the capacity of one&#x2019;s memory which developed in ancient Greece but is mainly known through Roman writers. It was held to be of particular value to orators and lawyers in memorizing long speeches, but was also seen as being of much wider application in the ages before printing, and indeed before widespread and cheap availability of a medium on which to write; a capacious and well-organized memory was regarded as central to education and culture. The Greek mnemonic technique was based on a building. The student of the art was instructed to study some large and complex building, memorizing its rooms and layout, and particular features of places in it. In doing this he should establish a specific order in which he visited the individual rooms and places. When memorizing a speech, he should then imagine himself to be walking through this building on his set route, and in each of the loci or places he had memorized he should establish imagines or images which were to be attached to each argument or point in his speech.&#x201d; <br><br>During the Latin influenced Middle Ages, it often continued to serve as an aid for making speeches, but under the pressure of the finest minds and greatest figures of the time, it was naturally integrated into the Christian doctrine and its cardinal virtues. After Charlemagne, we find the prestigious names of Albertus Magnus and Saint Thomas associated with it while the Dominican Order was spreading a domesticated use of it for the purposes of apologetics, conversion, and inquisition. Peter of Ravenna promoted a secular adaptation of this memory technique. <br><br>During the Renaissance while we certainly come across the presence of Erasmus, it is the major figures of Llull, Giullo Camillo, and Giordano Bruno in particular that diverted this art into the mystical, hermetic direction that would become the major philosophy of that era, while an entire section of the art, primarily dedicated to mnemonic techniques and procedures remained vital. Frances Yates provides a summary of this under the generic term of the &#x201c;classical art of memory.&#x201d; <br><br>The intellectual and spiritual situation of the art of memory evolved again during the seventeenth century. On the one hand, the importance of the art in accordance with Ramon Llull&#x2019;s definition began to dwindle: eventually all that remained of it with any potency was the search for THE method. At this same time the upholders of the magical, hermetic notion of this art had taken possession of the forefront of the stage of ideas--in any case at least since the &#x201c;revelation&#x201d; of the writings of Hermes Trismegistus by Isaac Casaubon in 1614. On the other hand, the art was associated with different modes of representing things and ideas, primarily in the development at this time of <i>emblemata</i>. These continue to be very poorly understood today despite the publication of Andr� Alciat&#x2019;s seminal book in Augsburg in 1531.<br><br> Seeing the fantastic proliferation of the written and printed word to the detriment of the speech memorized by heart and the oral tradition, the Western man of 1700 could have said to himself like Victor Hugo: &#x201c;This will kill that.&#x201d; Wouldn&#x2019;t it therefore be likely that under these conditions the still forming Masonic symbolism would become the storage, preservation, and transmission site for a particular form of the art of memory? This was an essentially oral form that was in the midst of being dethroned and swept aside by writing. This is what the historical developments and transformations of the Art would seem to suggest, in part. <br><br>Far from an elsewhere and nowhere of utopia according to Campanella, wouldn&#x2019;t the future operative and non-operative Freemasons of 1600-era Scotland, engaged on an extra-professional quest for method but remaining immersed nevertheless in the here and now of spiritually conflictive societies, be in the process of discovering the Masonic symbol beneath the memorized image? <br><br>If we accept the fact that Masonic symbols were created by their inventors as elements of language and communication intended to transmit moral and spiritual values capable of being made universal, just how did these inventors go about the task they set for themselves? <br><br>Their first step was to select the terrain and the domain on and in which to situate their analogies and metaphors. This would be the domain of the builder in which the &#x201c;graft&#x201d; comes into play, because it naturally combines the master builder (the Great Architect of the Universe), the conceiver of the edifice (the architect), and the worker (the mason on the construction site) in its implementation. The ultimate aim implied by the practices on the field of activity selected this way is well known: in the image of the original Temple, the Temple of Solomon, intended to welcome the divine presence among human beings and fix it to one location (the <i>Schekina</i>). It would consist of building and constructing every edifice naturally capable of permitting the individual to be protected, to live, and to shelter his family, while at the same time building his own self. This spiritual building will thereby ensure the liaison and dialogue between the &#x201c;little world&#x201d; that this individual embodies, and the organized &#x201c;large world&#x201d; in which he dwells, aware of the favor and good fortune that the Great Organizer will arrange to be his lot in return for his labor, his irreproachable conduct, and his loyalty toward Duty.</p><h2>The Second Indochina War: A Concise Political and Military History</h2><p>Now in a thoroughly revised edition, this influential book offers a concise history of the "Vietnam War" as seen by all sides, not just from the American perspective. Retaining its invaluable account of the strategies, perspectives, and internal politics of the Vietnamese Communists based on research in primary documents and interviews in Saigon and Hanoi, this completely updated and expanded edition incorporates the avalanche of documentation and secondary literature in both English and Vietnamese that has appeared over the past two decades. Distinguished scholar William Turley traces the conflict from its origins in the colonial period to its aftermath and shows how the local, national, regional, and global layers of conflict blended into a single event of great complexity. He takes a refreshingly objective look at contentious issues and concludes with a penetrating assessment of the claims, justifications, and "lessons" that scholars, statesmen, and strategists have advanced since the war's end.<br><br>More information is available on the author's website.</p><p><b>William S. Turley</b> is professor emeritus of political science at Southern Illinois University.Turley is a leading scholar on Vietnamese politics, and he has updated his classic account of the Second Indochina War to reflect not only the latest scholarship and memoirs but also the perspective gained from more than thirty years of peace. There is never a 'last word' on a complex event, but for scholars, veterans, and anyone else who wants to understand the war in its context, this excellent and judicious book is the place to start. I look forward to using it in class. (Brantly Womack, University of Virginia)<br><br>By viewing events almost as closely from Hanoi and Saigon as from Washington, Professor Turley spares us the rampant self-absorption so characteristic of most American accounts of the war. For younger generations wondering 'Why Vietnam?' this book is the best place to start seeking answers. (David G. Marr, Australian National University)<br><br>This new edition, buttressed by twenty years of new scholarship, is even more satisfying than the original impressive book. The author's lucid prose and keen analytic bent give the work a distinctive tone and penetration, and his mastery of Vietnamese-language material allows for a balance and depth not found in other surveys. (David Hunt, University of Massachusetts&#x2013;Boston)<br><br>Mandatory reading for everyone concerned with any of the Indochina states. Turley elegantly and vividly provides a comprehensive overview of the war, perceptive analysis of calculations at the top in Hanoi and Washington leading to the war's end, and compelling details of the prolonged and complex disputes within the Vietnamese communist leadership and followers and among Vietnamese, Chinese, Lao, and Cambodian actors.

Or that health insurance is too expensive, too uneven, too complicated&#x2014;and gives you too many forms to fill out. But the central problem is that too much medical care has too little value.<br><br> Dr. H. Gilbert Welch is worried about too much medical care. It&#x2019;s not to deny that some people get too little medical care, rather that the conventional concern about &#x201c;too little&#x201d; needs to be balanced with a concern about &#x201c;too much&#x201d;: too many people being made to worry about diseases they don&#x2019;t have&#x2014;and are at only average risk to get; too many people being tested and exposed to the harmful effects of the testing process; too many people being subjected to treatments they don&#x2019;t need&#x2014;or can&#x2019;t benefit from. <br><br> The American public has been sold the idea that seeking medical care is one of the most important steps to maintain wellness. Surprisingly, medical care is not, in fact, well correlated with good health. So more medicine does not equal more health; in reality the opposite may be true. <br><br> The general public harbors assumptions about medical care that encourage overuse, assumptions like it&#x2019;s always better to fix the problem, sooner (or newer) is always better, or it never hurts to get more information. <i>Less Medicine, More Health</i> pushes against established wisdom and suggests that medical care can be too aggressive. Drawing on his twenty-five years of medical practice and research, Dr. Welch notes that while economics and lawyers contribute to the excesses of American medicine, the problem is essentially created when the general public clings to these powerful assumptions about the value of tests and treatments&#x2014;a number of which are just plain wrong. <br><br>By telling fascinating (and occasionally amusing) stories backed by reliable data, Dr. Welch challenges patients and the health-care establishment to rethink some very fundamental practices. His provocative prescriptions hold the potential to save money and, more important, improve health outcomes for us all.</p><p><b>Dr. H. Gilbert Welch</b> is an academic physician, a professor at Dartmouth Medical School, and a nationally recognized expert on the effects of medical testing. He has been published in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>,<i> New York Times</i>,<i> Washington Post</i>, and <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and has appeared on <i>Today</i>. Dr. Welch is the author of three previous books, including the highly acclaimed <i>Overdiagnosed. </i>He lives in Thetford, Vermont.&#x201c;Avoiding medical jargon, Welch speaks directly to the layperson and focuses on certain assumptions that have increased consumption in a market-driven society; some of which have become so ingrained by popular media that refuting them seems downright scandalous...&nbsp;Welch&#x2019;s words, though wise beyond money, border on sacrilege in a country of generally healthy people who have developed an expensive health-care habit and who are expected to support a lucrative health-care industry. Welch&#x2019;s conversational style makes his prescription for better health an easy pill to swallow.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i>, starred review<br><br>&#x201c;A bright, lively discussion of the excesses of medical care to which patients often unwittingly go due to certain false assumptions...&nbsp;Welch demonstrates the flaws in these assumptions. His stories involve the risks, uncertainties and harms of cancer screenings, treatments for heart disease, drugs, medical devices and surgical procedures. He makes an especially strong case for the risks of mass screenings for cancer&#x2014;the fear, the false alarms, the overdiagnoses and the resulting overtreatments. Vivid images make what could be discouragingly technical quite understandable...&nbsp;Welch's engaging style and touches of humor make this an easy read, and the facts he presents make a convincing case.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>&#x201c;Read this book. It is smart, witty, wonderfully written, and above all wise. We've overmedicalized life and yet we need medicine throughout our lives.

Showing the dangers of our ill-informed enthusiasm for medicine, he brilliantly builds the case for respecting its power and limitations: to seek it when ill and all but avoid it when healthy.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Victor M. Montori, MD, Professor of Medicine, Mayo Clinic<br><br>&#x201c;Gil Welch's latest book shows us exactly how too much medical care can be harmful and even deadly.&nbsp; This is a needed corrective to the American attitude that the more screening and testing, the healthier we will be.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Marcia Angell, author of <i>The Truth About Drug Companies<br></i><br>&#x201c;Its title, &#x2018;Less Medicine, More Health,&#x2019;&nbsp;sums up his trenchant, point-by-point critique of test-based health care and quality control.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>New York Times</i></p><h2>The Everything Learning German Book: Speak, Write and Understand Basic German in No Time</h2><p>It&#x2019;s easy to become intimidated by the prospect of learning a foreign language, and many consider German to be the most difficult of all.

This facsimile reprint is of the <em>Household Edition of the Works of Charles Dickens</em>, published in the 1870s; the edition makes the work available again in a form in which tens of thousands of Victorians read it&#x2015;in two-column format, interspersed with illustrations throughout. </p> <p> <em>David Copperfield</em> was originally published in nineteen monthly parts between May 1, 1849 and November 1, 1850.* Each part except the last was of roughly the same length; the final installment was approximately twice as long as the others (and sold for 2 shillings, twice the price of previous parts). For the original serial publication, as well as early publication in book form, <em>David Copperfield</em> was illustrated by Hablot Browne (more commonly known as &#x201c;Phiz&#x201d;). </p> <p> Shortly after Dickens&#x2019; death in 1870 the British publisher Chapman &amp; Hall began to issue the <em>Household Edition of the Works of Charles Dickens</em> (not to be confused with the American <em>Household Edition of the Works</em>, which appeared in the 1860s). The principal illustrator for the edition was Fred Barnard, and the Dalziel brothers (the leading wood-engravers of the time) created the engravings from Barnard&#x2019;s illustrations; they described <em>The Household Edition</em> as &#x201c;by far the most important commission ever placed in our hands by Messrs. Chapman &amp; Hall.&#x201d; Volumes in <em>The Household Edition</em> began to appear in 1871, and the series was completed in 1879. Dickens&#x2019; works appeared in a great many Victorian editions (including numerous pirated ones). Scholars have understandably paid most attention to the earliest publication in serial form; <em>The Household Edition</em> may well have been the most popular form in which the novel appeared, however; the plates for <em>The Household Edition</em> were widely used for other editions as well, and it is certainly arguable that more Victorian readers would have read Dickens&#x2019; novels in this form than in any other. In 1911 the populist bibliophile J.A. Hammerton described <em>The Household Edition</em> as &#x201c;the most important illustrated edition&#x201d; of Dickens&#x2019; works. </p> <p> This is one of a series from Broadview Press of facsimile editions&#x2015;editions that provide readers with a direct sense of these works as the Victorians themselves experienced them. </p> <p> The breaks were as follows: I &#x2013; May 1849 (chs. 1&#x2013;3); II &#x2013; June 1849 (chs. 4&#x2013;6); III &#x2013; July 1849 (chs. 7&#x2013;9); IV &#x2013; August 1849 (chs. 10&#x2013;12); V &#x2013; September 1849 (chs. 13&#x2013;15); VI &#x2013; October 1849 (chs. 16&#x2013;18); VII &#x2013; November 1849 (chs. 19&#x2013;21); VIII &#x2013; December 1849 (chs. 22&#x2013;24); IX &#x2013; January 1850 (chs. 25&#x2013;27); X &#x2013; February 1850 (chs. 28&#x2013;31); XI &#x2013; March 1850 (chs. 32&#x2013;34); XII &#x2013; April 1850 (chs. 35&#x2013;37); XIII &#x2013; May 1850 (chs. 38&#x2013;40); XIV &#x2013; June 1850 (chs. 41&#x2013;43); XV &#x2013; July 1850 (chs. 44&#x2013;46); XVI &#x2013; August 1850 (chs. 47&#x2013;50); XVII &#x2013; September 1850 (chs. 51&#x2013;53); XVIII &#x2013; October 1850 (chs. 54&#x2013;57); XIX-XX &#x2013; November 1850 (chs. 58&#x2013;64). </p></p><h2>Research Methods: A Modular Approach</h2><p>APPROACH Sherri Jackson&#39;s RESEARCH METHODS: A MODULAR combines a lively writing style with a novel approach to offer a refreshing alternative for the research methods course.

The greatest surprise I encountered in discussing this topic over the past ten years was the consistency with which I was asked a single unvarying question: Are you writing about physical pain or mental pain? The overwhelming consistency of this response convinces me that modern culture rests upon and underlying belief so strong that it grips us with the force of a founding myth. Call it the Myth of Two Pains. We live in an era when many people believe--as a basic, unexamined foundation of thought--that pain comes divided into separate types: physical and mental. These two types of pain, so the myth goes, are as different as land and sea. You feel physical pain if your arm breaks, and you feel mental pain if your heart breaks. Between these two different events we seem to imagine a gulf so wide and deep that it might as well be filled by a sea that is impossible to navigate. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"This illuminating work boldly ranges beyond conventional boundaries to provide a deeper understanding of our common afflictions, our humanity, and our ennobling struggle for transcendence."--1992 PEN/Spielvogel-Diamonstein Award, Judges Martha Nussbaum, Joyce Carol Oates, Ronald Steel&nbsp;"Eloquent and fascinating . . . Morris does not dispel the mystery of pain. Instead he explores its full scope.

It is seen to be the product of two forces: Kuznets cycles of rising and decreasing within-nation inequalities, and convergence of mean incomes among countries. The relative strength of these two forces has profound political implications: Shall we live in the world of class cleavages, or of huge international income gaps?

Once widely disseminated, they tend to take on a life of their own. They become almost impossible to refute because &#x201c;everyone&#x201d; knows they&#x2019;re true. Anyone who dares to question their veracity gets written off as spiritually dull, lacking in faith, or liberal.<br>Admittedly, the consequences of some spiritual misconceptions aren&#x2019;t particularly devastating. For instance, if someone mistakenly believes that the Bible says that &#x201c;God helps those who help themselves&#x201d; or &#x201c;a penny saved is a penny earned&#x201d; or that Jesus was some sort of soft-skinned Western European guy with blue eyes who walked from town to town in an old bathrobe saying profound things in a wispy voice&#x2014;kind of a mystical hippy on Dramamine&#x2014; it will throw them off a degree or two, but it will hardly destroy their faith.<br><br><i><br></i>But far too often the consequences are spiritually devastating.<br>Think of the disillusionment that sets in when someone writes off God for failing to keep a promise that he never made. Or the despair that follows a step of faith that turns out to have been a leap onto thin ice.<br>That is why an expos� of the ten widely held but blatantly false spiritual urban legends that we&#x2019;re about to explore is so important. They aren&#x2019;t just harmless misunderstandings.They&#x2019;re spiritually dangerous errors that will eventually bring heartache and disillusionment to all who trust in them.<br>My bet is that you&#x2019;ve already seen through a few. Others you may have always questioned, but until now thought you were the only one who didn&#x2019;t &#x201c;buy it.&#x201d; Some may rock your boat. But whatever the case, I encourage you to examine each one with an open mind and an open Bible.<br>Measure Twice, Cut Once<br><br>There is an old carpenter&#x2019;s adage: &#x201c;Measure twice, cut once.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s based on the observation that once we&#x2019;ve cut a board too short, no matter how many more times we cut it, it will still be too short. The same holds true for the spiritual principles upon which we base our life. Once we&#x2019;ve made a decision or set a course of action, it&#x2019;s usually too late to go back and start checking out the accuracy of our assumptions.<br>The Bereans of New Testament times offer an example worth following. Believers who lived in theMacedonian city of Berea, they went so far as to check out everything the apostle Paul taught them, examining the Scriptures to see if what he said was really true.<br>Now remember, Paul was an apostle, an author of Scripture, God&#x2019;s spokesman. But rather than being offended, he praised them for their lack of gullibility and noble search for the truth. I encourage you to follow their example as we work through each of the ten spiritual urban legends to come. I think you&#x2019;ll discover not only that they are false but also that each one flatly con- tradicts what the rest of the Bible teaches. In many cases, they even contradict what their so-called supporting verses, or &#x201c;proof texts,&#x201d; actually say.<br>And, yes, I know that words like <i>dumb </i>and <i>stupid </i>are strong words. Whenever I use them when speaking to a larger group, I predictably get a couple of notes or even a face-to-face rebuke.Usually it&#x2019;s a mom trying to eradicate the words from her children&#x2019;s vocabulary. She wonders why I can&#x2019;t use kinder, gentler terms that would be more acceptable in play group.<br>But I can&#x2019;t. As noted above, these beliefs aren&#x2019;t just false. They aren&#x2019;t just unfortunate.They&#x2019;re no tmerely a few degrees off. They are dangerous.They are what the Bible calls &#x201c;foolish,&#x201d; which in modern day terms means &#x201c;stupid&#x201d; and &#x201c;dumb.&#x201d;2<br><i><br></i>Yet I want to make it clear that nothing in these pages is meant as an attack on the people who believe these things.They themselves aren&#x2019;t dumb.Their assumptions and beliefs are. If I&#x2019;d had more room in the title, I would have called this book <i>Ten Dumb Things That Smart, Sincere, Good, and Godly Christians Believe.<br></i>Each one of these spiritual urban legends is a bit like fool&#x2019;s gold. It looks great at first glance, but once tested, it proves worthless. No doubt we&#x2019;ve all jumped to some pretty foolish conclusions in our life. I know I have. But fortunately, early in my faith journey, I had some careful-thinking mentors who pointed out the folly of basing my belief system on what everybody else said rather than on careful biblical scrutiny. They taught me to avoid reading just my favorite verses.<br>They showed me the importance of reading all the surrounding verses&#x2014;and the rest of the book as well.<br>Their advice has served me well and saved me much heartache.<br>It has also solidified my confidence in the Bible.The more I&#x2019;ve learned to toss aside the clich�s, happy talk, and cultural assumptions that don&#x2019;t fit what the Bible actually says (or the way that life really works), the greater my trust in it as God&#x2019;s Word and the ultimate source of spiritual truth.<br>It&#x2019;s my hope that the pages of this book will do the same for you&#x2014;that they will help you question everything you hear and test everything you believe against the actual words and teaching of the Bible.</p><h2>Hide and Seek Fog</h2><p>In a Cape Cod seaside village, the children romp and play throughout a heavy fog with strange and mysterious effects.</p><p>Henri Sorensen lives in Denmark.</p><h2>Real Talk About Classroom Management: 50 Best Practices That Work and Show You Believe in Your Students (Corwin Teaching Essentials)</h2><p>This guide offers 50 proven best practices for managing today&#x2019;s classroom, complete with just-in-time tools and relatable teacher-to-teacher anecdotes and advice.

But Jordan lost control, allowed himself to be corrupted and transformed into the villainous Parallax. Later, Jordan reappeared and made the ultimate sacrifice&#x2014;a sacrifice that allowed him to become the Spectre, the Wrath of God.&nbsp;<br><br> After several years of activity on Earth, The Spectre became restless and sought a way to prove himself worthy of that noble reputation. See how a man born without fear and seeking to rebuild his life, puts cosmic forces into motion that will have repercussions not only on Earth but across the universe. This volume sets up the events of <i>Blackest Night</i> and revitalized Green Lantern as one of the most important heroes of the DCU!</p><p>Geoff Johns is an award-winning writer and one of the most popular contemporary comic book writers today. Johns is the author of The New York Times bestselling graphic novels Aquaman: The Trench, Blackest Night, Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps War, Justice League: Origin, Superman: Brainiac and Batman: Earth One which hit #1 on the bestseller list. He is also known for transforming Green Lantern into one of the most critically and commercially successful franchises in comics.<br> &nbsp;<br> Johns was born in Detroit and studied media arts, screenwriting, and film at Michigan State University. After moving to Los Angeles, he became an assistant to Richard Donner, director of Superman: The Movie. He and his mentor Donner later co-wrote Superman: Last Son featuring the return of General Zod.<br> &nbsp;<br> Johns has written for various other media, including episodes of Smallville, Arrow and Adult Swim's Robot Chicken, for which he was nominated along with his co-writers for an Emmy. He is the Chief Creative Officer of DC Entertainment and resides in Los Angeles, California.In 1994 DC Comics decided to shake up the long-running <i>Green Lantern</i> by killing off Hal Jordan, wielder of the ring of power since 1959, and bestowing power and costume on someone new. After a decade of fans' protests, however, a five-issue-spanning <i>Rebirth</i> resurrected Jordan (in superhero comics, no one ever really dies) and restored the original <i>Green Lantern</i> concepts. Bringing Jordan back wasn't easy because he had gone insane, murdered his fellow Green Lanterns, become all-powerful villain Parallax, and finally been transformed into the latest embodiment of godlike vengeance spirit the Spectre. Popular DC writer Johns set things right by means of a necessarily convoluted and contrived resurrection ploy that yet supplied the intergalactic brawls and superhero valor the fans demand. Meanwhile, Ethan Van Sciver's drawing epitomized the cluttered, over-rendered style dominating superhero comics today (in reviving classic characters, DC might have considered restoring the visual clarity of earlier comics eras, too). <i>Rebirth</i> was a smash serialized; the collected edition should be equally popular. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The little colony grew, split, and grew some more. By the early 2000s, offshoots roamed much of the northwestern corner of the state. Many folks were thrilled to have these new-old residents back adding untamed music to the great outdoors. A lot of other Montanans wanted the packs eradicated. Some days, it seemed that about all anybody around here did any more was argue over wolves.<br><br>On one of those days, a biologist working for Montana&#x2019;s Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks looked out his office window to find the street lined with outraged, placard-waving big game hunters convinced that wolves were going to eat up all the state&#x2019;s elk and deer. That biologist was the regional game manager, Jim Williams. You wouldn&#x2019;t have wanted his job just then.<br><br>We met to talk not long afterward. It was just a casual chat, but it changed my view of the balance of wild lives in the landscapes around us when he told me, &#x201c;Hardly anyone realizes that there are two or even three times as many cougars as wolves out in those woods and mountainsides. Now, the average cougar is bigger than the average wolf and consumes more wild meat than a wolf does. Cougars occasionally injure or kill humans. Wolves almost never do. Yet here we are dealing with outbreaks of near-hysteria over wolves while we don&#x2019;t hear much at all from the general public about cougars. Why? Mainly because the big cats are so good at not being seen.&#x201d;<br><br>Also known as the mountain lion or puma, the cougar is a stalk-and-ambush predator&#x2015;a spring-loaded embodiment of stealth. Unlike the wolf, it seldom travels in a group, doesn&#x2019;t conduct nightly choruses, prefers to keep to thick vegetation or broken terrain, readily climbs to find seclusion high among the branches of trees, and often drags its kill away from a conspicuous site to dine in a hidden nook. As if those traits weren&#x2019;t secretive enough, this hunter is mostly active at night and in the twilight hours. Not surprisingly, another common name for the cougar is ghost cat.<br><br>I first ran into Jim Williams many years ago a dozen miles east of the Continental Divide. He was a graduate student tracking cougars across the windy slopes of the Rocky Mountain Front with the help of radio collars. Although his career as a wildlife biologist led him to work with a variety of different animals, he rarely passed up any opportunity to go off chasing ghosts. Every time we got together, I would start off wondering whether I was going to hear more cougar news, new findings about the ecology of other species, insights about the social and political forces that influence game management, or a tale from his latest backcountry trip to climb one of the area&#x2019;s high summits.<br><br>Invariably, given his boundless enthusiasm plus a fondness for coffee, every one of those subjects&#x2015;and more&#x2015;got covered before he left. The pages of this book deliver much the same Jim Williams high-octane combo of science, adventure, and conservation. But here the mix is all related to his decades-long pursuit of a special interest in cougars, with each chapter uncovering more aspects of the lives the big cats work so hard to conceal.<br><br>Of all the large mammals in the western hemisphere, this feline, Puma concolor, is the most widespread. Its distribution extends from Canada&#x2019;s southern Yukon Territory all the way to Argentina and Chile. And in the second half of the book, Jim takes us to that far southern range as he joins researchers in ecosystems where the cougars&#x2019; neighbors include ocelots, maned wolves, guanacos, vicunas, and condors.<br><br>In North America, we think of cougars as being tied to the mountains and canyons out West. For the most part, they are. However, two centuries ago, their range sprawled from coast to coast. Cougars were exterminated from most of it by government-supported campaigns that relied heavily on poisoned baits. Harder to find than wolves and grizzlies, the last cats left in remote and rugged terrain escaped the continuing persecution aimed at those other large predators. Then, as the decades passed and attitudes toward meat-eating wildlife changed, cougar numbers started to rally across the western states. Puma concolor being the creature you don&#x2019;t know is there treading whisper-soft in the shadows, the resurgence of this major predator through the late twentieth century never got much attention, but it stands as one of the most remarkable wildlife comebacks in US history.<br><br>The party may just be getting started. Because adult cougars are fiercely territorial, young animals&#x2015;especially males&#x2015;approaching sexual maturity are forced out of fully occupied ranges. This pressure disperses cats far and wide in search of new homes with suitable cover, abundant prey, and, with luck, a mate. Some find their needs met in rural and suburban habitats where adaptable species such as white-tailed deer, raccoons, and wild turkeys provide ready meals. In recent years, cougars have appeared in various Midwest states and as far east as Missouri and even Connecticut.<br><br>These cats are like emissaries from the raw landscapes out West, probing the rest of the nation, showing us where patches of wildness remain, and bringing a fuller dimension of wildness to them. It&#x2019;s as if they&#x2019;re testing to find out just what folks have in mind when they say they want to preserve natural settings. How natural? How toothy?<br><br>Don&#x2019;t cougars pose a potential risk to us? Yes. But so do predator-less deer. Biologists have pointed out how restoring cougars to portions of the eastern United States could reduce overpopulated herds responsible for the spread of tick-borne diseases and for collisions with vehicles that leave many drivers injured, some permanently disabled, and more than a few dead. Here is the one formidably big, strong predator skilled enough at avoiding notice to live near surprisingly high numbers of people&#x2015;if allowed to stay. We&#x2019;ll find out if that will happen. And judging from the way cougars keep pushing eastward from the Rockies and the Black Hills of South Dakota, I&#x2019;d bet on sooner rather than later.<br><br>In the vast wetlands of southern Brazil&#x2019;s Pantanal, a breeding pair once emerged from a gallery forest and stopped perhaps fifty feet away from me, nuzzling each other. The short fur of their coats, suited to the tropics, lay plastered against their skin by the moist air, revealing every underlying muscle of their bodies. For once, it was the cougars that were in plain view and the human who wasn&#x2019;t, for I had been sitting very still beneath a tangle of leaves to keep watch on a path often used by jaguars, the Americas&#x2019; other great cats. A jaguar did come later that afternoon, but it&#x2019;s the two cougars I remember, each the most perfectly sculpted balance of grace and power I had ever seen.<br><br>To be able to introduce a book about this species is a privilege, especially a book by my fellow Montanan Jim Williams. As of this writing, he&#x2019;s busy as ever managing wildlife here&#x2015;and periodically disappearing into some nearby chain of peaks, the pampas of Argentina&#x2019;s Patagonia region, or a new national park in Chile to follow big stealthy cats.<br><br> &#x2013; Douglas H. Chadwick, April 30, 2017|Prologue<br>THE CROSSING<br><br>The big cat stole silent down rocky mountain slopes broken by bunchgrass, slipping unseen into the creek bottom. Behind him, the grunts of sparring bull bison retreated, giving way to the morning songs of red-winged blackbirds.<br><br>The color of honey, the color of caramel, the color of dry mountain meadows, invisible in the dim light, the mountain lion crept into the first grey of day through grasses still wet with dew, his amber eyes set on the dark of distant forests, sure to hold deer.<br><br>He was hungry. And he needed to move.<br><br>There was food behind him, deer and elk and even a few bighorn sheep and antelope. But he was young still, and knew to avoid the big old male lions that patrolled those herds. And so he moved, off the Montana mountaintop, under the fence that rings the National Bison Range, down from the rocky den where he&#x2019;d been born 18 months before.<br><br>His mother had kept him moving all this time, teaching him the stalk, teaching him the kill, teaching him to avoid the territorial old males along the way. He was hardwired to roam, to eat, to find a wild empty country of his own where he could stake his territory. Deer lived in the wetland thickets and river bottoms below the mountaintop, so he followed ancient feline highways along the streambeds, moving with the deer at dawn and dusk. <br><br>The cat headed east, upriver, toward mountains backlit by sunrise, doing what mountain lions have done here for 10,000 years. But times have changed. Between his old home on the National Bison Range and the deer-filled forests of the Mission Mountain Wilderness, a minefield of danger has grown up &#x2013; houses and dogs and guns and poisons. And now that strange new noise, a hiss with a hint of roar, rising and falling periodically, somewhere between here and the snow-capped peaks.<br><br>The National Bison Range is located just north of Missoula, Montana, a grassy 19,000 acres that rise in steep relief above a broad valley carved by Pleistocene ice. It is fenced to keep the bison in, but a thriving black bear population has dug holes beneath the wire and most large carnivores move freely on and off the range. Wolves, black bears, grizzly bears, coyotes and mountain lions all share the Bison Range, along with herds of prey.<br><br>The Bison Range also is sacred ground. The bunch-grass and forest-filled mountain complex lies within the boundaries of the Flathead Indian Reservation, home to the Salish, Kootenai and Pend d&#x2019;Oreilles people. In fact, it was a Tribal member who herded the Range&#x2019;s original bison a century ago -- from the prairies east of Glacier National Park, over the Continental Divide, and down into the Mission Valley. The valley is framed by protected lands -- to the west by the low-slung National Bison Range, and to the east by the soaring summits of the Mission Mountain Tribal Wilderness. Between lie the unprotected wetlands and river bottoms and glacial pothole lakes so popular with deer and mountain lions and, more recently, human habitats.<br><br>As he worked farther out onto the valley floor, the young lion slowed to a crawl. To his left, a large field stretched northward toward a barn and a few feeding deer. He was hungry. But the strange sound still spooked him, and he kept moving. A lone male can go as long as two weeks between kills, if necessary, and this was not the time to take risks, here in unknown country. Mountain lions have remarkable eyes, capable of seeing clearly through the dark of dusk and dawn hunting hours, but his ears were sharp, too, and he could hear the redhead ducks, mallards and Canada geese calling from pothole lakes as the early-spring sun rose. The territorial sign of other big cats &#x2013; the scent of urine and spray, the scrapes and scratch trees &#x2013; kept him traveling quietly along waters&#x2019; edge. A big male might lay claim to 150 square miles, so this was no place to stop.<br><br>And anyway, that new noise he&#x2019;d heard earlier had now grown quite loud and more frequent, rising and falling steadily, a low drone of moving sound.<br><br>Somewhere on the other side of that noise a graduate student slipped on wet grass as she scrambled down a sloped highway bank. Whisper Camel-Means &#x2013; a member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Indian Reservation &#x2013; was here to study the effectiveness of wildlife passages tunneled beneath the rush of US Highway 93. The road runs ribbon-straight through the heart of the valley, a dividing line that cuts across rich habitat and separates the Bison Range from the Wilderness. Her mind was on a camera trap she had set a week before, in a state-of-the-art wildlife underpass built beneath the busy north-south roadway.<br><br>For years, Tribal elders and biologists had negotiated with state and federal highway officials, designing a &#x201c;wildlife friendly&#x201d; reconstruction of Hwy 93. They called it The Peoples&#x2019; Way, and they gave it a motto: &#x201c;the road is a visitor.&#x201d; It would be made to serve the real residents &#x2013; the people and the elk and the bears and the big cats. Completed in 2010, it features 41 fish and wildlife crossing structures in 56 miles of highway &#x2013; overpasses and underpasses, culverts and bridges, all linking streams and ancient migration paths across the valley floor, connecting habitats from mountaintop to river bottom.<br><br>Whisper&#x2019;s camera traps were set to capture and record wildlife crossings beneath the pulse of log trucks and minivans. This was the sound, the rising and falling hiss of tire on tarmac, the lion had been hearing. He was near the forested eastern mountains now, could see the dark timber rising, but these flashes of light and steel raced steadily across what appeared to be a paved ridgeline. He could not see the terrain on the other side, and that made him cautious. Padding closer, he sniffed a web of metal fence, then followed the fenceline parallel with the highway toward a darkened tunnel. Low light and caves. He liked that. That&#x2019;s how he hunts. A thick layer of earth muffled the roar of traffic above, and he never heard the whirr of Whisper&#x2019;s remote camera.<br><br>The big cat slipped through, invisible except to the camera, and on the other side he could finally smell the sharp tang of Douglas fir and moist forest soil. He had passed unseen across one of Montana&#x2019;s busiest and most dangerous highways, a silent ghost hardwired to find the wild. Now he was on his own, staking and marking his hunting grounds, striding quickly toward a new high-country home among the deer herds of the Mission Mountains.<br><br>But he was still close enough that he could hear the sound of the trucks behind him as Whisper slipped down the highway slope. She never worried about encountering mountain lions during the day &#x2013; after all, she&#x2019;d always understood that the big cats preferred darkness. But Whisper knew to take care in bear country, so she made noise as she moved through tall vegetation and dense forest. Bears typically move on if they hear you approaching, but her mind was on that camera, not on predators.<br><br>At the tunnel, she edged along the wall to reach her camera. It was late morning now, and the sun was warming. Whisper toggled through the digital images and immediately noticed a time-stamped frame that had been snapped just a moment before she arrived. A chill up the spine. A quick catch of the breath. Hair suddenly on end. A big mountain lion. Skwtismy� in her native language. In broad daylight. Just now. Adrenaline. And then... a smile. This was exactly how it was supposed to work.<br><br>The big cat had moved safely beneath the highway, through a crossing structure that she and the biologists and the engineers had designed and built. It worked beautifully. Other images, at other passages along The Peoples&#x2019; Way, have captured bears and bobcats, deer and elk, skunks and owls and even otters. Wild nature needs room to roam &#x2013; to disperse and connect and migrate with the seasons &#x2013; and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes have set the global standard for wildlife connectivity across roadways.<br><br>Most all of the big carnivores that traditionally defined our nation have been squeezed into the protected fringes, the national parks and wilderness areas that provide a last refuge. But not the mountain lions. They live with us, from California to the Eastern seaboard, even if we seldom see them. Or, perhaps, because we seldom see them.

Our increasingly interconnected, digitized, and globalized world presents immense opportunities and unique challenges. Modern businesses and schools interact with individuals and organizations from a diverse range of cultural and national backgrounds&#x2014;increasing the likelihood for miscommunication, errors in strategy, and unintended consequences in the process. This has also spilled into our daily lives and the way we consume information today. Understanding how to navigate these and other pitfalls requires adaptability, nuanced cross-cultural communication, and effective conflict resolution. <i>Use Your Difference to Make a Difference </i>provides readers with a skills-based, actionable&nbsp;plan that transforms differences into agents of inclusiveness, connection, and mutual understanding.</p> <p>This innovative and timely guide illustrates how to leverage differences to move beyond unconscious biases, manage a culturally-diverse workplace, create an environment for more tolerant schooling environments, more trusted media, communicate across borders, find and retain diverse talent, and bridge the gap between working locally and expanding globally. Expert guidance on a comprehensive range of topics&#x2014;teamwork, leadership styles, information sharing, delegation, supervision, giving and receiving feedback, coaching and motivation, recruiting, managing suppliers and customers, and more&#x2014;helps you manage the essential aspects of international relationships and cultural awareness. This valuable resource contains the indispensable knowledge required to:</p> <ul> <li>Develop self-awareness needed to be a cross-cultural communicator</li> <li>Develop content, messaging techniques, marketing plans, and business strategies that translate across cultural borders</li> <li>Help your employees to better understand and collaborate with clients and colleagues from different backgrounds</li> <li>Help teachers build safe environments for students to be themselves</li> <li>Strengthen cross-cultural competencies in yourself, your team, and your entire organization</li> <li>Understand the cultural, economic, and political factors surrounding our world</li> </ul> <p><i>Use Your Difference to Make a Difference</i> is a must-have resource for any educator, parent, leader, manager, or team member of an organization that interacts with co-workers and customers from diverse cultural backgrounds.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p> The goal of <i>Use Your Difference to Make a Difference</i> is to strengthen self-awareness, acknowledge biases, connect with others in a meaningful way, and celebrate the differences around us all. Harmful behaviors, whether conscious or unconscious, can lead to social environments that perpetuate&#x2014;and even intensify&#x2014;hate and division. Only by acknowledging and understanding these behaviors can we learn to connect&#x2014;with ourselves, with others, with our world. Connection is a process that turns differences into mutual understanding. Connection enables us to care for each other and be more empathetic. To be truly connected, we must educate ourselves, choose not to perpetuate systemic bias, and effectively communicate with people with vastly different values, backgrounds, and beliefs. This book is a roadmap for navigating the path towards moral courage, compassion, and accountability. </p><p>It is within our human nature to protect ourselves and others from harm. Unfortunately, throughout our past and into the present day, we have misidentified groups&#x2014;whether comprising different religions, ethnicities, language, values, or cultures&#x2014;as threats to our safety. Self-preservation is a powerful instinct to ignore when faced with perceived dangers. Only by learning about those not like us can we eliminate our biases, ignore misinformation, and reject false narratives of "otherness." Slavery, homophobia, bigotry, misogyny&#x2014;these are not part of our genetic code; they are human creations. Educating ourselves on the lived experiences of others is crucial for leaving a better, more inclusive world to future generations. </p><p>We all have assumptions of the people around us, whether an immediate neighbor or someone halfway across the world. Culturally-intelligent communicators realize that not everyone views the world through the same cultural lens, they do not perpetuate biases and stereotypes. Using the methods contained within this book, you will learn to see things from new perspectives, engage those with different worldviews, and leverage your differences to make powerful connections. </p><p>We are living in an extremely diverse, inter- connected world. Technology allows people to interact and exchange ideas in ways that were not even imagined for almost all human history. The leaders of tomorrow need to understand how to connect with differences in a positive way. This book provides you with the knowledge and practical skills to transcend barriers, bridge cultures, and cultivate strong relationships with anyone, anywhere.</p><p>Praise for<br> <b>USE YOUR DIFFERENCE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE</b> </p><p>"A truly inspiring read and a must for anyone thinking of creating an inclusive culture within their workplace through understanding the role they can play."<br> <b>&#x2014;Asif Sadiq, MBE</b>, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging thought leader and global expert </p><p>"Tayo has provided the world with a tool for readers who are interested in diving far beneath the superficial treatment that diversity materials often receive.

Smith discusses the timing of their departure, their feelings about living in the spirit realm, and reincarnation. Stories that recount individual experiences with animals on earth as well as the spirit realm are most of the book, including ones about animals who want their humans to know that they didn't suffer in dying, that they may have actually orchestrated their death for a particular reason, that they forgive any wrongs or that they are planning to come back in another form. Perhaps most helpful is the chapter in which animals counsel their human friends not to grieve for them but to seek joy instead. For those new to animal communication, Smith includes a short instructional chapter. Readers open to Smith's claims about animal communication or who grieve departed furry friends will find much in these pages to offer comfort and hope. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Each of the 32 quick and easy exercises takes no more than 30 minutes and will teach you how to create a new street scene element such as doorways, buildings and people or work an exciting technique such as creating washes, mixing colours and playing with perspective. The exercises are all worked at postcard size ideal for a 6 x 4in (A6) watercolour pad, and actual-size tracings are included. The book is broken down into eight chapters: tone, colour, perspective, the wash, edge control, brush strokes, adding detail and, finally, putting it all together this last section contains 3 finished paintings that demonstrate how to integrate a combination of the elements into vibrant and inspiring street scenes; these complete paintings also have an accompanying actual-size tracing.</p><p>Painting exclusively in watercolour, Grahame Booth tutors workshops and holiday courses in Ireland and abroad. He is a popular demonstrator for art clubs and his success is reflected in many national and international awards. His work is featured in books, videos and art magazines, including <i>Artist and Illustrators</i>. Grahame is a member of the SAA and is based in Belfast, Northern Ireland. &nbsp;His work is represented in private and public collections including Belfast City Council, Ulster Independent Clinic and the Office of the Mayor of Annapolis, Maryland. He is Past President of the Ulster Watercolour Society. <br><br>&nbsp; <br><br>Grahames work is in a relatively loose, traditional style. His subject range is international, and his use of colour, light and shadow are particularly impressive.This is genuinely exciting evolution of a popular series. You&#39;ll be guided through some simple exercises and on to complete painting, gaining valuable insights that will develop and improve your skills. * Artbookreview.net * September 2017 Ready to Paint in 30 Minutes is a brand new series from Search Press aimed specifically at the complete beginner. The focus is to provide quick and easy instruction for anyone short on time, as each exercise is designed to take no more than 30 minutes. The series kicks off with two titles - Street Scenes by Grahame Booth and Flowers in Watercolour by Ann Mortimer. Street Scenes is broken down into eight chapters covering tone, colour, perspective, the wash. edge control, brush strokes, adding details and putting it all togethe. There are 32 easy exercises for you to work on, each of which covers an element of street scenes, such as doorways or people. The time is limited to 20 minutes spent on each and the size is limited to postcard size, which make them ideal for an A6 watercolour pad. Three finished paintings are demonstrated at the end of the book and are accompanied by actual size tracings to make it easier for the complete novice to get started with their painting. Ann Mortimer will be well known to Leisure Painter readers and in her 30 minute book she covers five main aspects of painting flowers in watercolour: working with watercolour, watercolour techniques, colour and tone, form and details, and finally, flowers in context. Once again the size and time is limited for each exercise and the final section, also accompanied by actual size tracings, demonstrates three paintings that combine all the techniques learnt. * The Leisure Painter * The original Ready to Paint series sold well to more experienced artists who might have been expected to dismiss it as &#39;jumped up painting by numbers&#39;. A complete re-think has produced this development which is a whole new departure. In place of complete paintings there are 30-odd half-hour exercises that concentrate on a single element -skies, shadows, trees, rosebuds, seed heads or leaves. There is also more emphasis on technique and therefore on the learning process. It&#39;s definitely worth a look. * The Artist * The artwork in the book is beautiful, and excitingly this step-by-step project book really makes the beginner believe they can achieve - and they can! There are 32 projects, gradually adding new techniques. I think in time, without perhaps realising, the beginner could produce some great pieces of art. I really appreciated the tracings which mean you don&#39;t feel pressure to become a great drawer and a great painter at the same time, and you don&#39;t have to face the daunting &#39;blank page&#39; before you start painting. The pencil lines form part of the finished piece of work. The small sizes of paintings also help as a beginner as its easy to paint on your lap or a table, and there&#39;s no need to worry about mixing huge quantities of paint or stretching the paper. I have worked through the first 4 projects up to now, which varied in their outcomes but, while the finished pieces are reasonable, its important to remember the book is about learning, not making masterpieces. At the start of the book there is some information about equipment and colours but to be honest, I&#39;d have liked a bit more info here, so I could identify types of brushes for example, and more on how to prepare and use a palette as I struggled preparing my colour mixes. I&#39;d have also liked a page with a palette image of the colours which are used throughout the book, so when the artist states he uses Windsor Red, for example, I could find my closest match. One of the best things about this book is that rather than technique exercises you learn the technique within a piece of work, so you end with finished pieces of work, and you can see why the different techniques are important. I&#39;m looking forward to continuing with the book, and it&#39;d perhaps be interested to then go back to the beginning and compare my second attempts and see my improvements. I&#39;d be very happy to recommend this book to a friend who wanted to learn to paint with watercolour, and learn the techniques ready to take on their own projects eventually. https://notcompulsory.blogspot.co.uk/2017/10/two-ready-to-paint-in-30-minutes.html * Not Compulsory *</p><h2>No Acting Please: A Revolutionary Approach to Acting and Living</h2><p>A collection of 125 acting exercises that are based on journal excerpts and dialogues from Mr. Morris' classes.

History is made by women, just as much as men. <br><br> Medea has been betrayed. Her husband, Jason, has left her for a younger woman. He has forgotten all the promises he made and is even prepared to abandon their two sons. But Medea is not a woman to accept such disrespect passively. Strong-willed and fiercely intelligent, she turns her formidable energies to working out the greatest, and most horrifying, revenge possible. <br> <br> Euripides' devastating tragedy is shockingly modern in the sharp psychological exploration of the characters and the gripping interactions between them.

G. Sebald, now with a gorgeous new cover by the famed designer Peter Mendelsund&nbsp;</strong></strong></p><p>Perfectly titled, <em>Vertigo</em> &#x2015;W.G. Sebald's marvelous first novel &#x2015; is a work that teeters on the edge: compelling, puzzling, and deeply unsettling.</p><p>An unnamed narrator, beset by nervous ailments, journeys accross Europe to Vienna, Venice, Verona, Riva, and finally to his childhood home in a small Bavarian village. He is also journeying into the past. Traveling in the footsteps of Stendhal, Casanova, and Kafka, the narrator draws the reader, line by line, into a dizzying web of history, biography, legends, literature, and &#x2015; most perilously &#x2015; memories.</p></p><p>It is not often that books receive the universal critical acclaim with which W.G. Sebald's work in English translation has been met. Both <i>The Emigrants</i> and <i>The Rings of Saturn</i> won the sort of plaudits that would enable most writers to die happy. Sebald first employed his limpid, literally entrancing style in <i>Vertigo</i>, which appeared in German in 1990 and then waited a decade for its English-language debut. Like <i>The Emigrants</i>, this earlier novel interweaves four different narratives, which cumulatively sound a single, transcendent note--in this case, that of memory.<p> Sebald begins with Marie Henri Beyle (better known as Stendhal), cruising through the French author's painful and unreliable recollections of his military career. Then he splices in his own voyage through Italy, allowing these historical and personal perspectives to intersect when we least expect them to. As the book develops, it returns to the same locations: Milan, Verona, Venice, and the Alps. And in the course of this fractured meandering, the reader cohabits with a haunted Franz Kafka, admires the serene beauty of the stars above Lake Garda, and ultimately returns to Sebald's home in Bavaria, where the author confronts his childhood memories.</p><p> For Sebald, a straight line is <i>never</i> the shortest distance between two points: he more often travels in concentric circles, or cuts wild capers from past to present. Yet the stumbling journey in <i>Vertigo</i> seeks to replicate the distorted and unfathomable workings of memory itself. And it succeeds to an astonishing extent, so that the acts of traveling, recalling, and writing are impossible to tell apart: </p><blockquote> On this occasion in the midst of the holiday season, the night train from Vienna to Venice, on which in the late October of 1980 I had seen nobody except a pale-faced schoolmistress from New Zealand, was so overcrowded that I had to stand in the corridor all the way or crouch uncomfortably among suitcases and rucksacks, so that instead of drifting into sleep I slid into my memories. Or rather, the memories (at least so it seemed to me) rose higher and higher in some space outside of myself, until, having reached a certain level, they overflowed from that space into me, like water over the top of a weir. </blockquote> Thus is the writer inundated.

It's a lot of responsibility, and it's boring, too, because Maddy doesn't talk. Ever.

Skin color and place of birth are no longer reliable signifiers of one's identity or origin. Simple questions like What are you? and Where are you from? aren't answered&#x2014;they are discussed. These eighteen essays, joined by a shared sense of duality, address the difficulties of not fitting into and the benefits of being part of two worlds.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the lens of personal experience, they offer a broader spectrum of meaning for race and culture. And in the process, they map a new ethnic terrain that transcends racial and cultural division.</p><p>"The future is here in these fascinating looks at complicated identities.

His buddy Kyle followed, working a toothpick in the side of his mouth, strolling like a man who didn&#x2019;t have nowhere to be, and leaning onto his truck advertising HAZLEWOOD CONTRACTING. It was winter and colder than a witch&#x2019;s tit, and Mickey slipped his hands into his thick Carhartt jacket. He stood near the truck gate and said, &#x201c;I heard you had some problems with Larry Cobb.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; Kyle said, firing up a Marlboro. &#x201c;To hell with that bastard.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You were doing some dozer work for him and he jacked your ass?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He says I did a half-ass job,&#x201d; Kyle said. &#x201c;That was a goddamn lie. When I come to talk to him, he sent out Debbi to talk. He&#x2019;s one sorry piece of shit.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you sue him?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Cost more for a lawyer than I&#x2019;d get.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You could whip his ass.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Larry&#x2019;s an old man,&#x201d; Kyle said. &#x201c;He ain&#x2019;t worth it. You can&#x2019;t just go beating up some old son of a bitch. That&#x2019;s like picking on a cripple. What makes me madder than anything is that I thought I was his friend. Me and him used to hunt together. He even took me out to his place in Colorado and introduced me to his high-dollar friends. We&#x2019;d shoot skeet and drink Coors Light in the Jacuzzi.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I thought he was my friend, too,&#x201d; Mickey said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Till you and Tonya split up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I never done a damn thing to that man,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And he knows his daughter is bat shit crazy. She takes Xanax like they&#x2019;re Tic Tacs. Then he sued me for nearly a hundred grand, about bankrupted me just because our divorce didn&#x2019;t sit well with him and Debbi.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Like I said,&#x201d; Kyle said. &#x201c;That man&#x2019;s a genuine piece of shit.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Huddle House hadn&#x2019;t been there long, opening up that summer with all the other places built after the tornado. People in Tibebhah County saying that twister may have been the best thing that happened since the Choctaws sold out. Even though seventeen people died, they now had a Subway, a KFC, and even a Wal-Mart. Mickey leaned over the tailgate of the big truck, watching the traffic speeding by the exit on Highway 45. Kyle flicked away his spent Marlboro, firing up another. His skin was burnt-red and he wore his graying hair cut long and stylish like some country music singer, along with a thin, wispy beard that was also turning gray. Kyle didn&#x2019;t know he was old. He still wore a leather puka shell necklace he&#x2019;d bought down in Panama City Beach.<br> &#x201c;Someone needs to put that man in his place,&#x201d; Mickey said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kyle turned from the traffic to look at his old buddy. His face didn&#x2019;t show nothing, light blue eyes looking right through him. &#x201c;What are you thinking, man?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Shit, I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hell you don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Kyle said. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t call me for the fellowship and biscuits and gravy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I just think it&#x2019;s wrong is all,&#x201d; Mickey said. &#x201c;The way Larry Cobb has spent his whole life making money by wiping his ass with people in this town.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You can either pray on it, or shoot his ass.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mickey shook his head. &#x201c;What if there was another way?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kyle squinted into the smoke as he studied Mickey&#x2019;s face. Mickey knew he was interested, that he had him, even just a little. He&#x2019;d been about half and half whether he was going to even mention the thing. But he knew he needed help and Kyle Hazlewood was one of the few people he trusted in Tibbehah County, this busted-ass place ninety miles from Memphis and too damn close to Tupelo. He needed a friend right now, a man he could rely on to get the job done. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He ever tell you about his special room?&#x201d; Mickey said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You talking about that room off his closet?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Where he keeps his found money.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Is that what he called it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I seen it,&#x201d; Kyle said, rubbing his nose. &#x201c;Larry&#x2019;d get drunk on Wild Turkey and he&#x2019;d wander back there just to show you what he got. Man can&#x2019;t help himself. He got stacks and stacks of money. He told me it was because his daddy told him to never trust no banks.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;His daddy also told him don&#x2019;t pay taxes, either,&#x201d; Mickey said. &#x201c;You know how much shit that man has done off the books with that logging operation?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;How much?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Last time I seen it, it was more than a million.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Holy shit,&#x201d; Kyle said. His cell phone ringing. He took it off his hip, saw the number, and turned it off. &#x201c;Just what you thinking, man?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mickey turned back to the Huddle House, watching the waitress behind the glass refilling cups and talking with a couple old men in the back booth. A raggedy minivan pulled into the parking lot and a fat woman with a fat baby waddled on in to get her morning feed. Kyle hadn&#x2019;t moved. He was shivering a little, wearing that imitation leather red-and-black motorcycle jacket he&#x2019;d had for years. Mickey remembered when Kyle was the king of Tibbehah High, rolling around the town Square in his bad ass El Camino. That same El Camino now sitting outside his work shed on blocks.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I got a court-ordered judgment against me for a hundred grand,&#x201d; Mickey said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just saying it&#x2019;d be funny to pay back Larry with his own goddamn money.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You talking about robbing him?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No, sir,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m talking about taking what&#x2019;s ours. I got a plan, but need you to be a part of it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, man,&#x201d; Kyle said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a high-tech safe. He paid a couple thousand for it at the Costco in Memphis. It ain&#x2019;t opening with no crowbar.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mickey pushed himself away from the big truck. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need a crowbar if you got the combination.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;How the hell you know that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I used to be his favorite son-in-law.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You were his only son-in-law.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just talking,&#x201d; Mickey said. &#x201c;I just wanted to see if you&#x2019;re interested first. Me and you been pals a long time. And when I heard Larry had cornholed you, too. Well, I just started thinking on the situation and how to make things right.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What if the combo don&#x2019;t work?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I got a backup plan,&#x201d; Mickey said. &#x201c;But one step at a time. I just need to know, are you in?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wind kicked up Kyle&#x2019;s long gray hair, the pinpoint of the Marlboro glowing in the morning cold. Trucks and cars sped up and down Highway 45, passing Tibbehah like it wasn&#x2019;t no more than a spec on a map. Mickey had wanted to buy him a new jacket for Christmas, but then he&#x2019;d forgot. If this here deal worked out, Kyle could buy something made of real leather this time. Maybe he could help Kyle pull himself out of the shit.

But nothing like this. I ain&#x2019;t no criminal.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Shit, you know stealing from a thief ain&#x2019;t stealing at all?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What is it, then?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mickey rubbed his face and spit onto the eroding ridge. &#x201c;Justice.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x25ac;<br> &nbsp;<br> Quinn Colson sat behind the wheel of his official sheriff&#x2019;s truck, a big F-250 diesel nicknamed the Big Green Machine, looking out at a tired old apartment complex in South Memphis. There were signs adverting move-in specials and monthly rentals with an entire wing of the apartments gutted, no doors or windows, a big Dumpster below toppling with trash. The complex was on Winchester, a half-mile from the Fed Ex facility, and every few minutes a big jet would take off, rattling the truck, the apartments, and anything under its path. Lillie Virgil had come up with him, as she was the one who&#x2019;d helped him track down what he needed since she had once worked as a cop in Memphis. They talked a little while they waited. Quinn saying that all the planes reminded him of his last deployment, a tent city outside an airfield in Afghanistan. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You were telling me something?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;About some kids you met there?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I talk too much.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You make goddamn Gary Cooper seem like a Chatty Cathy,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Talk to me, Quinn. What else do we have to do but wait and watch?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You mind if I fire up a cigar?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, sir, I do,&#x201d; Lillie said. &#x201c;They smell like shit. Besides, you want those folks to see the smoke coming from the cracked windows?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hell,&#x201d; Quinn said. &#x201c;You really think they&#x2019;d notice?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quinn glanced down at the ashtray and a half-smoked La Gloria Cubana Black. Seemed like a damn shame to leave it, but he&#x2019;d rather leave it than listen to Lillie complain. Lillie was what you&#x2019;d call a strong personality, nearly as tall as him, twice as mean, and perhaps the best shot in north Mississippi. Probably all of Mississippi. Before she&#x2019;d became a cop, she&#x2019;d been a star shooter for the Ole Miss Rifle team. Her unruly brown hair was twisted up into a bun and any hint of her femininity covered up with a bulky hunting jacket and ball cap.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They&#x2019;d left their uniforms and badges back in Tibbehah County. He didn&#x2019;t want anyone to confuse why he was working in another state as a Mississippi sheriff.<br> &#x201c;My last two deployments were at Camp Eggers,&#x201d; Quinn said. &#x201c;I just got an email from a kid in my platoon. He was talking about things that happened there and those kids. I shouldn&#x2019;t have brought it up.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Goddamn it, Quinn,&#x201d; Lillie said. &#x201c;Just tell me the fucking story.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;The Afghan kids sold trinkets outside the gates. You know, necklaces, tea pots, sometimes old weapons they&#x2019;d found. They didn&#x2019;t go to school. They made money for their families, shuffling between two forwarding operating bases at Eggers and Camp ISAF.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hold old were they?&#x201d; Lillie asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There were two brothers,&#x201d; Quinn said. &#x201c;Abraham and Abdullah. I think they were ten and twelve. And their friends Noah, who was about their age, and Mariam. Mariam was a cute little girl. Precocious. She couldn&#x2019;t have been more than seven or eight. Not much older than Jason.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Was this part of winning hearts and minds?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;U.S. Army Rangers don&#x2019;t do a lot of that,&#x201d; Quinn said. &#x201c;Mainly we just shoot bad guys and blow shit up. When we&#x2019;d return from a mission, I&#x2019;d buy stuff from those kids and send it home. I got to know them. That&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quinn turned on the big truck&#x2019;s motor to get the heat going again. He caught a glance of his face in the rearview mirror, all hard planes and angles from his distant Choctaw roots and his hair buzzed on the sides with a half inch on top. He was a wiry and lean man, still hard from ten years in the service. The expression on his face wasn&#x2019;t pleasant. Next to him, Lillie rested her shoulder against the passenger door and its fogged-up window. In profile, Lillie had a very pretty face although to tell her she was pretty might be construed as an insult. Wearing makeup, letting down her hair, or wearing girly clothes wasn&#x2019;t a big part of her life. She never gave a damn about what people whispered about her.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You send that shit home to your sister?&#x201d; Lillie asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Mainly to my mom,&#x201d; Quinn said. &#x201c;And Anna Lee when I got drunk. The deployment was the longest I&#x2019;d been on. I got to know those kids pretty well. I&#x2019;d give them a few bucks on Thursdays before Juma. That&#x2019;s the Muslims&#x2019; holy day of prayer.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;nbs...</p><h2>Stop Eating Your Heart Out: The 21-Day Program to Free Yourself from Emotional Eating (How to Stop Overeating, for Fans of Brain Over Binge)</h2><p><p><b><strong>You Don&#x2019;t Need Food to Self-Soothe</strong></b></p><p><strong>According to experts, 75 percent of overeating is emotional eating.

Now, she creates breathtaking suspense and harrowing plot twists in her most masterful, enthralling novel yet.<br><br>A policewoman in a small Florida community, Sloan Reynolds knows that her modest upbringing was a long way from the social whirl of Palm Beach, the world inhabited by her father and her sister, Paris. Total strangers to Sloan, they have never tried to contact her&#x2014;until a sudden invitation arrives, to meet them and indulge in the Palm Beach social season.<br> <br> A woman who values her investigative work more than a Dior dress, Sloan is unmoved by the long-overdue parental gesture. But when FBI agent Paul Richardson informs her that her father and his associates are suspected of fraud, conspiracy, and murder, Sloan agrees to enter into her father's life&#x2014;while hiding her true profession.<br> <br> Sloan's on top of her game until she meets Noah Maitland, a multinational corporate player and one of the FBI's prime suspects&#x2014;and finds herself powerfully attracted to him, against her deepest instincts. When a shocking murder shatters the seductive facade of the wealth and glamour surrounding her, Sloan must maneuver through a maze of deceit and passion, to find someone to trust&#x2014;and to decipher the truth behind those terrifying whispers in the dark.</p><p>After 30 years, Sloan Reynolds is about to meet the father she never knew. Claiming that his ill health has led him to attempt reconciliation, Carter Reynolds invites Sloan to meet him and his other daughter, Paris, in the glamorous world of Palm Beach, Florida. With all the sense and courage that her job as a cop requires, Sloan refuses the invitation, convinced that nothing good could come from meeting her absentee father. But when FBI agent Paul Richardson intervenes and explains that Reynolds is under suspicion, she agrees to enter the world of the social elite in order to help investigate her father.<p> Prepared to hate Palm Beach and all its inhabitants, Sloan is surprised to find herself drawn towards Paris, her cranky great-grandmother, and Paris's neighbors, the Maitland family--particularly Noah Maitland. Noah has all the characteristics of Mr. Perfect, which is exactly what scares Sloan. How could someone so sophisticated, smart, and handsome be attracted to her? </p><p> But just as the two begin to explore their attraction, Sloan's hopes for her new family and friends crumble. Paul closes in on the dark truth about Carter Reynolds and his suspicions expand to include Noah. Soon, Sloan is an unwilling accomplice in the investigation against Noah, and when a horrible murder occurs, she just may be the next victim. </p><p> Bestselling author Judith McNaught has all the ingredients for a great romantic thriller in <i>Night Whispers</i>: the handsome and not-quite-aboveboard hero, the optimistic lady-cop, a handful of exotic and unreadable socialites, and all in all she delivers the goods. Even so, the fact that nearly everyone couples off at the end feels slightly trite, and the motivations of the true killer are somewhat unconvincing. Apart from these minor flaws, <i>Night Whispers</i> remains an entertaining and certainly worthwhile read. <i>--Nancy R.E.

The insights contained in the book originate from ancient indigenous cultures. According to what the author learned from his elders, human beings always have a choice between the path of competition and the path of cooperation. The healing of the earth depends on the healing of humanity and will only become possible as we return to a relationship of cooperation with all of life.

Indigenous people believe that we humans have all the necessary talents to be caretakers of Mother Earth. This book reveals our true capacities in a strong and clear way, offering the reader not only information, but a real opportunity to participate in the work that needs to be done to save our planet.</p><p></p><h2>Spiritual Care in an Age of #BlackLivesMatter: Examining the Spiritual and Prophetic Needs of African Americans in a Violent America</h2><p>Wednesday, November 9, 2016 is the day that changed America. A Republican business mogul and reality television host who once proclaimed that if women didn&#x2019;t accept the intimate advancements of men, then men were could simply grab these women by a particularly sensitive extremity below their stomachs, snatched the electoral collegiate vote and since then has worked tirelessly on reversing President Barack Obama&#x2019;s progressive policies and pushing immigration legislation backwards.<br> <br> This vital resource guide incorporates the basic understandings of spiritual care with the current social, emotional, existential and spiritual needs of African Americans simply surviving in Trump&#x2019;s violent America. It&#x2019;s one-of-a-kind, offering specific spiritual care strategies and interventions for African Americans dealing with particular physical, social and emotional health challenges in the midst of rising statistics of racism, sexism, classism, and homophobia leading to violence in the United States. <br> <br> Intended for anyone in academia or the helping professions, this comprehensive work benefits those seeking to provide spiritual care to African American hospital patients, counseling clients, church congregants and parishioners, military veterans, or returning service members.

Tracking the enemy, lying in wait for the target to appear&#x2014;then they shoot to kill. Armed with an unerring eye, infinite patience and a mastery of camouflage, combat snipers stalk the enemy with only one goal...<br><br>In World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and Beirut, American snipers honed the art of delivering a single deadly shot from nowhere&#x2014;and devastating enemy morale. They met the enemy on his own turf, picking off officers, unwary soldiers, and even other snipers from extraordinary distances of up to 1 � miles. Now, these uncommon men tell their stories: of the emotions felt when a man's face came into their crosshairs and they pulled the trigger, of the nerve-wracking hours and days of waiting, motionless, for the enemy, of the primal savagery of a sniper duel.<br> <br>Often trained haphazardly in wartime, and forgotten in times of peace, combat snipers were officially recognized after the Vietnam War, when the Marine Corps became the first military branch to start a full-time sniper school. <i>One Shot-One Kill</i> is their powerful record of desperate trials and proud victories.<br> <br>A main selecton of the Military Book Club!</p><p><b>Charles W.

He stood six foot three, weighed almost three hundred pounds, wore size sixteen shoes, and poured out his darkest sorrows onstage in a voice like a raging chainsaw. Half a century after his first hits, his sound still terrifies and inspires. <br>Born Chester Burnett in 1910, the Wolf survived a grim childhood and hardscrabble youth as a sharecropper in Mississippi. He began his career playing and singing with the first Delta blues stars for two decades in perilous juke joints. He was present at the birth of rock 'n' roll in Memphis, where Sam Phillips-who also discovered Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis-called Wolf his "greatest discovery." He helped develop the sound of electric blues and vied with rival Muddy Waters for the title of king of Chicago blues. He ended his career performing and recording with the world's most famous rock stars. His passion for music kept him performing-despite devastating physical problems-right up to his death in 1976. <br>There's never been a comprehensive biography of the Wolf until now. Moanin' at Midnight is full of startling information about his mysterious early years, surprising and entertaining stories about his decades at the top, and never-before-seen photographs.

Across caf�s and hotels, apartments and galleries, the family mixes with a lively group of Parisian and international actors, designers, writers, and students. Furthermore, Coggins weaves in fascinating bits of the city's history and artistic lore, from Victor Hugo's interior designs to the painting that legend has it started Impressionism, to delight Francophiles all over.</p><p><b>David Coggins</b> is the author and illustrator of the travel memoir, <i>The Nostalgic Heart</i>, recipient of an Independent Publisher Book Award.

Suspected of involvement in an assassination plot against Queen Mother Tenel Ka of the Hapes Consortium, Han and Leia Solo are on the run, hunted by none other than their own son, Jacen, whose increasingly authoritarian tactics as head of GA security have led Luke and Mara Skywalker to fear that their nephew may be treading perilously close to the dark side. <br><br>But as his family sees in Jacen the chilling legacy of his Sith grandfather, Darth Vader, many of the frontline troops adore him, and countless citizens see him as a savior.

Ben Skywalker was alone in the vessel he&#x2019;d found on Ziost, trusting it to understand that he wanted it to take him home. No navigation array, no controls, no pilot&#x2019;s seat . . . nothing. Through the bulkheads he could see stars as smeared points of light, but he&#x2019;d stopped finding the ship&#x2019;s transparency unsettling. The hull was there. He could both see it and not see it. He felt he was in the heart of a hollowed red gem making its sedate way back to the Core.<br><br>And there was no yoke or physical control panel, so he had to think his command. The strange ship, more like a ball of rough red stone than a vessel made in a shipyard, responded to the Force.<br><br>Can&#x2019;t you go faster? I&#x2019;ll be an old man by the time I get back.<br><br>The ship felt instantly annoyed. Ben listened. In his mind, the ship spoke in a male voice that had no sound or real form, but it spoke: and it wasn&#x2019;t amused by his impatience. It showed him streaked white lights streaming from a central point in a black void, a pilot&#x2019;s view of hyperspace, and then an explosion.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, so you&#x2019;re going as fast as you can . . .&#x201d; Ben felt the ship&#x2019;s brief satisfaction that its idiot pilot had understood. He wondered who&#x2019;d made it. It was hard not to think of it as alive, like the Yuuzhan Vong ships, but he settled for seeing it as a droid, an artifact with a personality and&#x2014;yes, emotions. Like Shaker.<br><br>Sorry, Shaker. Sorry to leave you to sort it all out.<br><br>The astromech droid would be fine, he knew it. Ben had dropped him off on Drewwa. That was where Shaker came from, like Kiara, and so they were both home now. Astromechs were good, reliable, sensible units, and Shaker would hand her over to someone to take care of her, poor kid . . .<br><br>Her dad&#x2019;s dead and her whole life&#x2019;s upended. They were just used to lure me to Ziost so someone could try to kill me. Why? Have I made that many enemies already?<br><br>The ship felt irritated again, leaving Ben with the impression that he was being whiny, but he said nothing. Ben didn&#x2019;t enjoy having his thoughts examined. He made a conscious effort to control his wandering mind. The ship knew his will, spoken or unspoken, and he still wasn&#x2019;t sure what the consequences of that might be. Right then, it made him feel invaded, and the relief at finding the ancient ship and managing to escape Ziost in it had given way to worry, anger, and resentment.<br><br>And impatience. He had a comlink, but he didn&#x2019;t want to advertise his presence in case there were other ships pursuing him. He&#x2019;d destroyed one. That didn&#x2019;t mean there weren&#x2019;t others.<br><br>The Amulet wasn&#x2019;t that important, so why am I a target now?<br><br>The ship wouldn&#x2019;t have gone any faster if he&#x2019;d had a seat and a yoke to occupy himself, but he wouldn&#x2019;t have felt so lost. He could almost hear Jacen reminding him that physical activity was frequently displacement, and that he needed to develop better mental discipline to rise above fidgeting restlessness. An unquiet mind wasn&#x2019;t receptive, he said.<br><br>Ben straightened his legs to rub a sore knee, then settled again cross-legged to try meditating. It was going to be a long journey.<br><br>The bulkheads and deck were amber pumice, and from time to time, the surfaces seemed to burn with a fire embedded in the material. Whoever had made it had had a thing about flames. Ben tried not to think flame, in case the ship interpreted it as a command.<br><br>But it wasn&#x2019;t that stupid. It could almost think for him.<br><br>He reached inside his tunic and felt the Amulet, the stupid worthless thing that didn&#x2019;t seem to be an instrument of great Sith power after all, just a fancy bauble that Kiara&#x2019;s dad had been sent to deliver. Now the man was dead, all because of Ben, and the worst thing was that Ben didn&#x2019;t know why.<br><br>I need to find Jacen.<br><br>Jacen wasn&#x2019;t stupid, either, and it was hard to believe he&#x2019;d been duped about the Amulet. Maybe it was part of some plan; if it was, Ben hoped it was worth Faskus&#x2019;s life and Kiara&#x2019;s misery.<br><br>That&#x2019;s my mission: put the Amulet of Kalara in Jacen&#x2019;s hands. Nothing more, nothing less.<br><br>Jacen could be anywhere now: in his offices on Coruscant, on the front line of some battle, hunting subversives. Maybe this weird Force-controlled ship could tap in and locate him. He&#x2019;d be on the holonews. He always was: Colonel Jacen Solo, head of the Galactic Alliance Guard, all-around public hero holding back the threats of a galaxy. Okay, I&#x2019;m feeling sorry for myself. Stop it. He couldn&#x2019;t land this ship on a Coruscant strip and stroll away from it as if it were just a TIE fighter he&#x2019;d salvaged. People would ask awkward questions. He wasn&#x2019;t even sure what it was. And that meant it was one for Jacen to sort out.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Ben said aloud. &#x201c;Can you find Jacen Solo? Have you got a way of scanning comlinks? Can you find him in the Force?&#x201d;<br><br>The ship suggested he ought to be able to do that himself. Ben concentrated on Jacen&#x2019;s face in his mind, and then tried to visualize the Anakin Solo, which was harder than he thought.<br><br>The sphere ship seemed to be ignoring him. He couldn&#x2019;t feel its voice; even when it wasn&#x2019;t addressing him or reacting to him, there was a faint background noise in his mind that gave him the feeling the vessel was humming to itself, like someone occupied with a repetitive task.<br><br>&#x201c;Can you do it?&#x201d; If it can&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;ll try to land inside the GAG compound and hope for the best. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want Galactic Alliance engineers crawling all over you with hydrospanners, I bet.&#x201d;<br><br>The ship told him to be patient, and that it had nothing a hydrospanner could grip anyway.<br><br>Ben occupied himself with trying to pinpoint Jacen before the ship could. But Jacen&#x2019;s trick of hiding in the Force had become permanent; Ben found he was impossible to track unless he wanted to be found, and right then there was nothing of him, not a whisper or an echo. Ben thought he might have more luck persuading the ship to seek holonews channels&#x2014;or maybe it was so old that it didn&#x2019;t have the technology to find those frequencies.<br><br>Hey, come on. If it managed to destroy a freighter on the power of my thoughts alone, it can find a holonews signal.<br><br>Ah, said the ship.<br><br>Ben&#x2019;s mind was suffused with a real sense of discovery. The ship dropped out of hyperspace for a moment and seemed to cast around, and then it felt as if it had found something. The starfield&#x2014;visible somehow, even though the fiery, rocky bulkheads were still there&#x2014;skewed as the ship changed course and jumped back into hyperspace. It radiated a sense of happy satisfaction, seeming almost . . . excited.<br><br>&#x201c;Found him?&#x201d;<br><br>The ship said it had found what it was seeking. Ben decided not to engage it in a discussion of how it could find a shutdown Jacen hiding in the Force.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, let me know when we get within ten thousand klicks,&#x201d; Ben said. &#x201c;I can risk using the comlink then.&#x201d;<br><br>The ship didn&#x2019;t answer. It hummed happily to itself, silent but filling Ben&#x2019;s head with ancient harmonies of a kind he&#x2019;d never imagined sounds could create.<br><br>Colonel Jacen Solo&#x2019;s cabin, Star Destroyer Anakin Solo, extended course, heading 000&#x2014;Coruscant, via the construum system<br><br>None of the crew of the Anakin Solo seemed to find it odd that the ship was taking an extraordinarily circuitous course back to Coruscant.<br><br>Jacen sensed the general resigned patience. It was what they expected from the head of the Galactic Alliance Guard, and they asked no questions. He also sensed Ben Skywalker, and it was taking every scrap of his concentration to focus on his apprentice and locate him.<br><br>He&#x2019;s okay. I know it. But something didn&#x2019;t go as planned.<br><br>Jacen homed in on a point of blue light on the bridge repeater set in the bulkhead. He felt Ben at the back of his mind the way he might smell a familiar but elusive scent, the kind that was so distinctive as to be unmistakable. Unharmed, alive, well&#x2014;but something wasn&#x2019;t right. The disturbance in the Force&#x2014;a faint prickling sharpness at the back of his throat that he&#x2019;d never felt before&#x2014;made Jacen anxious; these days he didn&#x2019;t like what he didn&#x2019;t know. It was a stark contrast with the days when he had wandered the galaxy in search of the esoteric and the mysterious for the sake of new Force knowledge. Of late, he wanted certainty. He wanted order, and order of his own making.<br><br>I wasn&#x2019;t ridding the galaxy of chaos then. Times have changed. I&#x2019;m responsible for worlds now, not just myself.<br><br>Ben&#x2019;s mission would have taken him . . . where, exactly? Ziost. Pinpointing a fourteen-year-old boy&#x2014;not even a ship, just fifty-five kilos of humanity&#x2014;in a broad corridor coiling around the Perlemian Trade Route was a tall order even with help from the Force.<br><br>He&#x2019;s got a secure comlink. But he won&#x2019;t use it. I taught him to keep transmissions to a minimum. But Ben, if you&#x2019;re in trouble, you have to break silence . . .<br><br>Jacen waited, staring through the shifting displays and readouts that mirrored those on the operations consoles at the heart of the ship. He&#x2019;d started to lose the habit of waiting for the Force to reveal things to him. It was easy to do after taking so much into his own hands and forcing destiny in the last few months.<br><br>Somewhere in the Anakin Solo, he felt Lumiya as a swirling eddy eating away at a riverbank. He let go and magnified his presence in the Force.<br><br>Ben . . . I&#x2019;m here, Ben . . .<br><br>The more Jacen relaxed and let the Force sweep him up&#x2014;and it was now hard to let go and be swept, much harder than harnessing its power&#x2014;the more he had a sense of Ben being accompanied. Then . . . then he had a sense of Ben seeking him out, groping to find him.<br><br>He has something with him. Can&#x2019;t be the Amulet, of course. He&#x2019;ll be angry I sent him on an exercise in the middle of a war. I&#x2019;ll have to explain that very, very carefully . . .<br><br>It had just been a feint to get him free of Luke and Mara for a while, to give him some space to be himself. Ben wasn&#x2019;t the Skywalkers&#x2019; little boy any longer. He would take on Jacen&#x2019;s mantle one day, and that wasn&#x2019;t a task for an overprotected child who&#x2019;d never been allowed to test himself far from the overwhelmingly long shadow of his Jedi Grand Master father.<br><br>You&#x2019;re a lot tougher than they think. Aren&#x2019;t you, Ben?<br><br>Jacen felt the faint echo of Ben turn back on him and become an insistent pressure at the back of his throat. He took a breath. Now they both knew they were looking for each other. He snapped out of his meditation and headed for the bridge.<br><br>&#x201c;All stop.&#x201d; The bridge was in semi-darkness, lit by the haze of soft green and blue light spilling from status displays that drained the color from the faces of the handpicked, totally loyal crew. Jacen walked up to the main viewport and stared out at the stars as if he might see something. &#x201c;Hold this station. We&#x2019;re waiting for . . . a ship, I believe.&#x201d;<br><br>Lieutenant Tebut, current officer of the watch, glanced up from the console without actually raising her head. It gave her an air of disapproval, but it was purely a habit. &#x201c;If you could narrow that down, sir . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what kind of ship,&#x201d; Jacen said, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;ll know it when I see it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right you are, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>They waited. Jacen was conscious of Ben, much more focused and intense now, a general mood of business-as-usual in the ship, and the undercurrent of Lumiya&#x2019;s restlessness. Closing his eyes, he felt Ben&#x2019;s presence more strongly than ever.<br><br>Tebut put her fingertip to her ear as if she&#x2019;d heard something in her bead-sized earpiece. &#x201c;Unidentified vessel on intercept course. Range ten thousand kilometers off the port beam.&#x201d;<br><br>A pinpoint of yellow light moved against a constellation of colored markers on the holomonitor. The trace was small, perhaps the size of a starfighter, but it was a ship, closing in at speed.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know exactly what it is, sir.&#x201d; The officer sounded nervous. Jacen was briefly troubled to think he now inspired fear for no apparent reason. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t match any heat signature or drive profile we have. No indication if it&#x2019;s armed. No transponder signal, either.&#x201d;<br><br>It was one small vessel, and this was a Star Destroyer. It was a curiosity rather than a threat. But Jacen took nothing for granted; there were always traps. This didn&#x2019;t feel like one, but he still couldn&#x2019;t identify that otherness he sensed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s decelerating, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let me know when you have a visual.&#x201d; Jacen could almost taste where it was and considered bringing the Anakin Solo about so he could watch the craft become a point of the reflected light of Contruum&#x2019;s star, then expand into a recognizable shape. But he didn&#x2019;t need to; the tracking screen gave him a better view. &#x201c;Ready cannons and don&#x2019;t open fire except on my order.&#x201d;<br><br>In Jacen&#x2019;s throat, on a line level with the base of his skull, there was the faint tingling of someone&#x2019;s anxiety. Ben knew the Anakin Solo was getting a firing solution on him.<br><br>Easy, Ben . . .<br><br>&#x201c;Contact in visual range, sir.&#x201d; Tebut sounded relieved. The screen refreshed, changing from a schematic to a real image that only she and Jacen could see. She tapped her finger on the transparisteel. &#x201c;Good grief, is that Yuuzhan Vong?&#x201d;<br><br>It was a disembodied eye with double&#x2014;well, wings on each side. There was no other word to describe them. Membranes stretched between jointed fingers of vanes like webbing. The dull amber surface seemed covered in a tracery of blood vessels. For a brief moment, Jacen thought it was precisely that, an organic ship&#x2014;a living vessel and ecosystem in its own right, of the kind that only the hated Yuuzhan Vong invaders had created. But it was somehow too regular, too constructed. Clustered spires of spiked projections rose from the hull like a compass rose, giving it a stylized cross-like appearance.<br><br>Somewhere in his mind, Lumiya had become very alert and still.<br><br>&#x201c;I knew the Yuuzhan Vong well,&#x201d; said Jacen. &#x201c;And that&#x2019;s not quite their style.&#x201d;<br><br>The audio link made a fizzing sound and then popped into life.<br><br>&#x201c;This is Ben Skywalker. Anakin Solo, this is Ben Skywalker of the Galactic Alliance Guard. Hold your fire . . . please.&#x201d;<br><br>There was a collective sigh of amused relief on the bridge. Jacen thought that the fewer personnel who saw the ship&#x2014;and the sooner it docked in the hangar, to be hidden with sheeting from curious eyes&#x2014;the better.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re alone, Skywalker?&#x201d; Technically, Ben was a junior lieutenant, but Skywalker would do: Ben wouldn&#x2019;t, not now that he had the duties of a grown man. &#x201c;No passengers?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only the ship . . . sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Permission to dock.&#x201d; Jacen glanced around at the bridge crew and nodded to Tebut. &#x201c;Kill the visual feed. Treat this craft as classified. Nobody discusses it, nobody saw it, and we never took it onboard. Understood?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir. I&#x2019;ll clear all personnel from Zeta Hangar area. Just routine safety procedure.&#x201d; Tebut was just like Captain Shevu and Corporal Lekauf: utt...</p><h2>Discipleship (Dietrich Bonhoffer Works-Reader&#39;s Edition)</h2><p><p>"Cheap grace is the mortal enemy of our church. Our struggle today is for costly grace." And with that sharp warning to his own church, which was engaged in bitter conflict with the official Nazified state church, Dietrich Bonhoeffer began his book <i>Discipleship</i> (formerly entitled <i>The Cost of Discipleship</i>). Originally published in 1937, it soon became a classic exposition of what it means to follow Christ in a modern world beset by a dangerous and criminal government. At its center stands an interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount: what Jesus demanded of his followersand how the life of discipleship is to be continued in all ages of the post-resurrection church.</p><p>"Every call of Jesus is a call to death," Bonhoeffer wrote. His own life ended in martyrdom on April 9, 1945.</p><p>Using the acclaimed <i>DBWE</i> translation, adapted to a more accessible format, this new edition features supplemental material from Victoria J.

First, in order to motivate K-12 students, we need to reach them where they are&#x2015;and little kids are inherently interested in the natural world around them. If we motivate them, they will persist and graduate. And if they are motivated by science, we will ultimate have more college graduates with highly marketable skills in STEM fields&#x2015;areas of great demand in today&#x2019;s economy. Second, adding the Arts to STEM to create STEAM acknowledges that the arts and science are linked.

D. Cohen's important and seminal work on the history and development of Judaism between 164 BCE to 300 CE. Cohen's synthesis of religion, literature, and history offers deep insight into the nature of Judaism at this key period, including the relationship between Jews and Gentiles, the function of Jewish religion in the larger community, and the development of normative Judaism and other Jewish sects. Cohen offers students more than just history, but an understanding of the social and cultural context of Judaism as it developed into the formative period of rabbinic Judaism. This new edition includes a brand-new chapter on the parting of ways between Jews and Christians in the second century CE. From the Maccabees to the Mishnah remains the clearest introduction to the era that shaped Judaism and provided the context for early Christianity.</p></p><p><p><b>Shaye J. D. Cohen</b> is the Nathan Littauer Professor of Hebrew Literature and Philosophy in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations at Harvard University. One of the foremost experts on Jewish history and culture, he is the author of several books, including <i>The Beginnings of Jewishness: Boundaries, Varieties, Uncertainties and Why Aren't Jewish Women Circumcised? Gender and Covenant in Judaism.</i></p>"The term 'classic' is too often abused and overused, but in the case of Shaye J. D. Cohen's <i>From the Maccabees to the Mishnah</i> the term is perfectly appropriate. How many books published in the 1980s are still useful today, let alone continue to remain required reading? It is a cause for celebration that this book is now available to a new generation of readers." <br>&#x2014;Richard Kalmin, Theodore R. Racoosin Professor of Rabbinic Literature and Culture, Jewish Theological Seminary<br><br>"Cohen's 1987 volume was widely acknowledged to be a superb overview of Jewish life in the pivotal era from 200 BCE to 200 CE. This extensively updated and expanded third edition is supplemented by a masterful presentation of a crucial issue that has been debated during the past few decades, namely, Judaism and Christianity's parting of ways in antiquity. The present volume guarantees that Cohen's work will remain indispensable for many years to come." <br>&#x2014;Lee Levine, Professor Emeritus of Jewish History and Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem<br>"<i>From the Maccabees to the Mishnah</i> continues to be the essential introduction to ancient Judaism. Its crystalline clarity, absolute command of&#x2014;and respect for&#x2014;the facts, and sustained intelligence make it an accessible and important read for everyone from interested lay-people, to undergraduates, to professional scholars. The new chapter, on the separation of Christianity from Judaism, is the most sensible treatment of this controversial topic available."<br>&#x2014;Seth Schwartz, Lucius N.

Here he did some of his best writing, and his experiences in the mountains are connected to twelve of his most famous works, including For Whom the Bell Tolls. Hemingway declared that the ranch near the small, wilderness town of Cooke City, Montana, on the edge of Yellowstone, was one of his favorite places to write in the world, on par with Paris and Madrid. </p> <p>Yet Hemingway&#x2019;s time in the Yellowstone High Country has never been thoroughly examined&#x2014;until now. After years of painstaking research, author Chris Warren takes readers on an astonishing journey into one of the most important periods in the life of one of the world&#x2019;s most important writers. Winner of the Nobel Prize for literature, Hemingway was at his best&#x2014;as a man, father, and writer&#x2014;when he was in the Yellowstone High Country, and in this fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable book, Warren examines what Hemingway did here, what he wrote here, and how his experiences and the people he met here shaped his life and work. This is a Hemingway that few readers knew existed, living in a place that few scholars knew was so essential to his writing. </p> <p>Author Chris Warren, a resident of Cooke City, Montana, has spent years researching Hemingway&#x2019;s connection to the area. In 2018 he presented a paper on Hemingway&#x2019;s final short story, which was set in Cooke City, to the Hemingway Society in Paris, France. Warren&#x2019;s research was instrumental in bringing the society&#x2019;s biennial conference to Cooke City, Montana, and Sheridan, Wyoming, in 2020.</p></p><p>Author Chris Warren, a resident of Cooke City, Montana, has spent years researching Hemingway&#39;s connection to the area.

While grappling with their identity and sexuality, often alone, they also faced academic meltdown, their parents&#x2019; divorce, and the looming pressure of what might come after high school. Written in alternating chapters from both Tegan's and Sara&#x2019;s points of view, the book is a raw account of the drugs, alcohol, love, music, and friendship they explored in their formative years. </p><p>A transcendent story of first loves and first songs, <i>High School </i>captures the tangle of discordant and parallel memories of two sisters who grew up in distinct ways even as they lived just down the hall from each another. This is the origin story of Tegan and Sara.</p></p><p>During the course of their twenty-year career, Tegan and Sara have sold well over one million records and released eight studio albums. They have received three Juno Awards, a Grammy nomination, a Governor General&#x2019;s Performing Arts Award, and the 2018 New York Civil Liberties Union Award. They have performed on some of the world&#x2019;s biggest stages, from Coachella to the Academy Awards. Outspoken advocates for equality, in 2016 Tegan and Sara created the Tegan and Sara Foundation, which fights for health, economic justice, and representation for LGBTQ girls and women. The sisters currently reside in Vancouver, British Columbia, and split their time between there and Los Angeles, California.

The truth of nostalgia is that it must have multiple lenses to operate in its most flourishing form. Much like in their music, in this book, the voices of Tegan and Sara are two distinct bodies of water flowing into the same harmonious river, spilling through the echoing hallways of old high schools, through the bedrooms of first heartbreaks, through the old haunts that remind you of your own. This book is a triumph of memory, affection, and engaging writing.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<b>HANIF ABDURRAQIB</b>, author of <i>Go Ahead in the Rain: Notes to a Tribe Called Quest</i></p><p>&#x201c;This book is the LSD-fueled, wallet-chained, Kurt Cobain&#x2013;inspired handbook of how to become young, queer rock stars, written by chapter-swapping twins who I wish I had read when I was in high school.

In reflecting on that torturous span of time spent agonizing over one&#x2019;s body, friendships, parents, and desires, this book highlights how high school is less of a place or memory but a metaphor for uncertainty, and underlines the salvation that can only be found in music. High School foreshadows the beginning of a rich and riveting literary career.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<b>VIVEK SHRAYA</b>, musician and author of <i>I'm Afraid of Men</i></p><p>&#x201c;This book is one of the most interesting and brave coming-of-age stories I have read in many years. Tegan and Sara reveal the confusion, the unraveling of personal truths, the fear, the excitement, the shame and the seclusion that many of us endure as we make our way through the world. This is also a book about how music saves people, how music gives us a voice and a reason to keep going.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<b>JANN ARDEN</b>, singer, songwriter, and author of <i>Feeding My Mother</i></p><p>&#x201c;A sweet and salty coming-of-age memoir.

Hughes and veteran clinical psychologist Jonathan Baylin guide readers through the intricate web of neuronal processes, hormones, and chemicals that drive&#x2015;and sometimes thwart&#x2015;our caregiving impulses, uncovering the mysteries of the parental brain.<br><br> The biggest challenge to parents, Hughes and Baylin explain, is learning how to regulate emotions that arise&#x2015;feeling them deeply and honestly while staying grounded and aware enough to preserve the parent&#x2013;child relationship. Stress, which can lead to &#x201c;blocked&#x201d; or dysfunctional care, can impede our brain&#x2019;s inherent caregiving processes and negatively impact our ability to do this. While the parent&#x2013;child relationship can generate deep empathy and the intense motivation to care for our children, it can also trigger self-defensive feelings rooted in our early attachment relationships, and give rise to &#x201c;unparental&#x201d; impulses.<br><br> Learning to be a &#x201c;good parent&#x201d; is contingent upon learning how to manage this stress, understand its brain-based cues, and respond in a way that will set the brain back on track. To this end, Hughes and Baylin define five major &#x201c;systems&#x201d; of caregiving as they&#x2019;re linked to the brain, explaining how they operate when parenting is strong and what happens when good parenting is compromised or &#x201c;blocked.&#x201d; With this awareness, we learn how to approach kids with renewed playfulness, acceptance, curiosity, and empathy, re-regulate our caregiving systems, foster deeper social engagement, and facilitate our children&#x2019;s development.<br><br> Infused with clinical insight, illuminating case examples, and helpful illustrations, <em>Brain-Based Parenting</em> brings the science of caregiving to light for the first time. Far from just managing our children&#x2019;s behavior, we can develop our &#x201c;parenting brains,&#x201d; and with a better understanding of the neurobiological roots of our feelings and our own attachment histories, we can transform a fraught parent-child relationship into an open, regulated, and loving one.</p><p><p><strong>Daniel A.

I&#x2019;M twelve years old and a seventh grader at Alice Deal Middle School in Washington, DC. My two favorite foods are pizza and egg rolls. I&#x2019;m on the student council, I&#x2019;m in the Scrabble club, and I plan to try out for soccer.<br> <br>I also work for the FBI.<br> <br>I know. That last one kind of comes out of the blue, doesn&#x2019;t it?<br> <br>Technically they classify me as a &#x201c;covert asset,&#x201d; which sounds very James Bond spylike but only means they want to keep me a secret. After all, it would be pretty embarrassing for them to admit they get help from a twelve-year-old, and it would be even worse if one of the guys on the Ten Most Wanted list showed up at my front door in a bad mood. So the covert part is good for both of us.<br> <br>Becoming a detective wasn&#x2019;t something I meant to do. It just sort of happened because I notice things other people don&#x2019;t. My brain&#x2019;s weird that way. It spots details that seem insignificant and snaps them together like puzzle pieces.<br> <br>The only people outside the Bureau who are supposed to know my status are my parents and my best friend Margaret. But that changed the day the Romanian Mafia kidnapped me after school. I was taking a shortcut behind the Safeway supermarket, and unless they were trying to influence any upcoming student council votes, it meant my identity was no longer a secret.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s funny because earlier that day Margaret had warned me not to take that route. Normally we walk home together. But on Thursdays she has piano, so I go alone. That&#x2019;s when I look for shortcuts. Not because I&#x2019;m in a hurry, but because it&#x2019;s like another puzzle.<br> <br>&#x201c;There are a lot of Dumpsters back there,&#x201d; she pointed out when I told her about it. &#x201c;And you know what Ben Franklin said about Dumpsters. &#x2018;Nothing good ever happens when you&#x2019;re surrounded by them.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty sure Ben Franklin was dead about a hundred and fifty years before the Dumpster was invented,&#x201d; I countered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Then maybe I saw it on a poster. Either way, it&#x2019;s good advice. You shouldn&#x2019;t go back there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It may smell bad,&#x201d; I said, feeling suddenly defensive, &#x201c;but it&#x2019;s not like it&#x2019;s dangerous or anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hmmm,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;And how do you know that?&#x201d;<br> <br>I thought about it for a moment and smiled. &#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s called the Safeway. If it was dangerous it would be called the Un-Safe Way.&#x201d;<br> <br>She didn&#x2019;t find this nearly as clever as I did. So while I laughed, she just shook her head and said, &#x201c;Boys are soooo funny.&#x201d; Then she leaned in close and added, &#x201c;And soooo stupid.&#x201d;<br> <br>Considering I was kidnapped in the exact place she warned me not to go, I&#x2019;d say that little nugget belongs on a poster too. In my defense, I was going to walk the long way, but it started raining and I didn&#x2019;t want to get soaked.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d just squeezed through the gap in the fence and was hurrying behind the store holding my backpack over my head when I noticed the delivery truck. It should&#x2019;ve been parked by the loading dock, but I was too busy worrying about getting wet to pay attention to that.<br> <br>The rain was so hard I could see through its windshield only when the wipers swished across the glass. That&#x2019;s why I didn&#x2019;t notice the driver had gotten out and left the engine running. I figured someone was just sitting inside waiting for the storm to pass.<br> <br>When he stepped out from behind a Dumpster I almost crashed into him, which would have hurt because he was enormous. The sign on the truck said it belonged to a flower shop called the Happy Leprechaun, but this guy was neither. He was about six foot four, three hundred pounds, and looked like a professional wrestler. One of the villains.<br> <br>He just stared at me, unconcerned about the rain pelting down on his giant bald scalp, and smiled. For a nanosecond I thought I was letting my imagination run wild. Then I looked down and noticed he wasn&#x2019;t wearing comfortable shoes like a delivery person would. He had on steel-toed work boots popular among factory workers, bricklayers, and international assassins.<br> <br>I sprinted in the opposite direction, digging around in my backpack as I ran. I was trying to find the &#x201c;panic button&#x201d; the FBI had issued me. All I needed to do was push it twice and a team of agents would be put on instant alert. Unfortunately, he got to me before I got to it.<br> <br>He tackled me and we skidded across the wet pavement into a pile of old fruit cartons. At first I thought I&#x2019;d sliced my knee open, but what looked like blood turned out to be rotted strawberries smushed into my jeans. I tried to scramble up onto my feet, but he wrapped his arms around my head and put me in a sleeper hold. Just before I blacked out I looked at all the Dumpsters and told myself that I really should start following Margaret&#x2019;s advice.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know how long I was unconscious, but when I woke up, I had a throbbing headache and was lying on the floor of the truck with my feet bound together and my hands tied behind my back.<br> <br>I let out a low, painful moan. &#x201c;Uunnnnnffff.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Feel better if sleep,&#x201d; he said with a thick accent. &#x201c;Twenty minute.&#x201d;<br> <br>For a few seconds my vision was blurry, but when things came into focus I saw something beautiful&#x2014;my backpack. He must have picked it up so no one would find it and come looking for me. That meant I still had a chance to press the panic button. I just needed to distract him long enough to scoot over to it.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d taken a hostage survival course at Quantico, the FBI training center, but at the time I couldn&#x2019;t imagine anyone wanting to kidnap me, so I didn&#x2019;t pay as much attention as I should have. Crazy stupid, I know, but at least I remembered the basics.<br> <br>SURVIVAL STEP 1&#x2014;Build a Rapport with Your Captor<br> <br>&#x201c;That was an impressive tackle,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Are you a football player?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Football is baby sport,&#x201d; he scoffed. &#x201c;Pads. Helmets. I play man sport. Rugby.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I bet you&#x2019;re great at it,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Did you play back home in Romania?&#x201d;<br> <br>He looked into the rearview mirror and eyed me suspiciously. &#x201c;How you know I Romanian?&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t want to tell him that the FBI had warned me that the Romanians were after me or that I saw the Romanian flag tattooed on his forearm when he put me in the sleeper hold. I wanted him to like me, so I tried buttering him up.<br> <br>&#x201c;My grandfather is from Romania,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I have a picture of him when he was a soldier and he looks just like you.&#x201d;<br> <br>This made him smile. (For the record my papa Gio is from Italy, and my grandpa Ted grew up in New Hampshire. But I think it&#x2019;s okay to lie when you&#x2019;ve been abducted.)<br> <br>&#x201c;By the way, as one Romanian to another,&#x201d; I continued, &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;ve made a mistake. I think you nabbed the wrong kid.&#x201d;<br> <br>The smile turned into a scowl and I worried that I&#x2019;d offended him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not saying you&#x2019;re not good at your job,&#x201d; I added. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that with peer pressure and our need to fit in, kids look and dress so much alike that even we have trouble telling each other apart. One time my parents drove right by me at pickup. My own parents. So there&#x2019;s no shame in grabbing the wrong one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not wrong,&#x201d; he replied forcefully.<br> <br>SURVIVAL STEP 2&#x2014;Disrupt Your Captor&#x2019;s Train of Thought<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you mean &#x2018;not wrong&#x2019; as in I&#x2019;m not wrong in what I&#x2019;m saying? Or &#x2018;not wrong&#x2019; as in you&#x2019;re not wrong in whom you kidnapped?&#x201d;<br> <br>I waited for a response, but all I heard was a low, frustrated growl. I assumed this was his deep-thinking noise.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t use pronouns, it really makes the conversation hard to follow. You need to say &#x2018;You&#x2019;re not wrong&#x2019; or &#x2018;I&#x2019;m not wrong.&#x2019; Especially in a situation like this with threats and demands. The wrong pronoun could have someone else ending up with your ransom money, and that wouldn&#x2019;t be good for either one of us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not wrong!&#x201d; he barked again as if saying it louder suddenly solved the grammar issues. Just then he swerved to avoid another car, blasted his horn, and yelled what I assumed were choice Romanian curse words. I figured he was distracted enough for me to start inching toward my backpack.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t feel bad,&#x201d; I continued. &#x201c;I understand how hard it is to learn a new language. My family moves all the time. I&#x2019;ve had to learn French and Italian. It&#x2019;s molto difficile. That&#x2019;s Italian for &#x2018;very difficult.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop talk!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a perfect example of what I mean. You said &#x2018;stop talk&#x2019; but it should be &#x2018;stop talking.&#x2019; English is so complicated. But let&#x2019;s forget about grammar and get back to you kidnapping the wrong person. Like I said, it&#x2019;s an easy mistake and easy to fix. If you let me go, I promise not to tell anyone. Just drop me off at the nearest Metro station.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shut mouth or else!&#x201d;<br> <br>The &#x201c;or else&#x201d; was ominous, and combined with the continued lack of pronouns it reminded me of the third step from my training.<br> <br>SURVIVAL STEP 3&#x2014;Do Not Antagonize Your Captor<br> <br>(When I told Margaret about the steps, she couldn&#x2019;t believe this wasn&#x2019;t first.)<br> <br>So far I&#x2019;d managed to get about halfway to the backpack, but I still needed one big push to reach it. When my FBI handler warned me about the Romanians, I did some studying and came across a website with phrases in different languages. I&#x2019;d learned one just in case a moment like this arrived.<br> <br>&#x201c;Vehicolul meu aerian e plin cu maimute!&#x201d;<br> <br>I wasn&#x2019;t sure about my pronunciation, but it must have sounded Romanian enough because moments later he veered over to the side of the road and slammed on the brakes. The truck came to a screeching halt that sent me tumbling across the floor.<br> <br>At this point the backpack was just beyond my fingertips. I was about to scoot the last little bit when he stood up, walked into the back of the delivery truck, and leaned over me, no regard for personal space (or dental hygiene).<br> <br>&#x201c;What saying you?&#x201d; he demanded, his face red and splotchy.<br> <br>&#x201c;I said that if you let me go I won&#x2019;t tell anyone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he replied as he leaned even closer. &#x201c;What saying you Romanian?&#x201d;<br> <br>I gulped and gave it another try, hoping I&#x2019;d remembered it correctly. One wrong word could give the sentence a totally different meaning.<br> <br>&#x201c;Vehicolul meu aerian e plin cu maimute!&#x201d;<br> <br>Judging by his glower, I was pretty sure I&#x2019;d ruined everything. I could just imagine the funeral, with my FBI instructor saying, &#x201c;I told him not to antagonize his captor.&#x201d; And Margaret shaking her head and responding, &#x201c;And I told him not to go behind the Safeway.&#x201d;<br> <br>He reached down and pressed his beefy hands against the sides of my head, and I waited for the inevitable crushing of my skull. But that&#x2019;s not what happened. Instead he flashed a huge yellow-toothed grin and laughed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hubbercraft?&#x201d; he asked, mispronouncing the word as he continued to laugh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I replied, smiling back and repeating the phrase in English. &#x201c;My hovercraft is full of monkeys.&#x201d; It was a silly phrase from a silly website, but it seemed to do the trick.<br> <br>Rapport had finally been established.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re funny,&#x201d; he said as he helped me back into an upright position.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;By the way, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re funny&#x2019; is excellent subject/verb agreement. I wonder if the fact that you were more relaxed helped&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Now shut mouth!&#x201d;<br> <br>Okay, so it was only limited rapport.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, and forget about backpack,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I already took out what you&#x2019;re looking for.&#x201d;<br> <br>He cackled and my heart sank.<br> <br>&#x201c;No call home for you,&#x201d; he added as he pulled my phone out of his shirt pocket and dangled it in the air. I tried not to show relief that he had only found my phone and not the panic button.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said, sounding as disappointed as I could. &#x201c;No call home.&#x201d;<br> <br>Fifteen minutes later we pulled off the highway onto a farm road and parked behind a barn. Everything was quiet for a moment until he said, &#x201c;Do not joke when here. Understand?&#x201d;<br> <br>It was more of a warning than an order, as if the next person I met might not have a sense of humor.<br> <br>&#x201c;I understand,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br> <br>He untied my feet and led me into the barn, my sneakers squishing down into the mud as we walked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sit here and wait quiet,&#x201d; he instructed when we reached an old wooden picnic table.<br> <br>SURVIVAL STEP 4&#x2014;Brains Are Better Than Muscles<br> <br>I knew I was about to come face-to-face with Nicolae Nevrescu, a ruthless gangster known as &#x201c;Nic the Knife.&#x201d; He was the prime suspect in the case I was working on, and considering his reputation, I figured I was running out of time to act. The more I thought about my situation, the more upset it made me. And the more upset I got, the harder it was to breathe.<br> <br>At first my breaths were slow and labored, but then I started to gasp for air.<br> <br>&#x201c;Quiet!&#x201d; the kidnapper told me.<br> <br>My gasping intensified and I leaned forward against the table in full panic mode.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is wrong?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>I was trying to figure out how to hyperventilate and talk at the same time when a new voice came to my rescue.<br> <br>&#x201c;He needs his inhaler&#x2014;inhalator,&#x201d; he said, using the Romanian word.<br> <br>I looked up from the table and saw that it was Nevrescu.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I wheezed as I nodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where it is?&#x201d; asked the kidnapper.<br> <br>&#x201c;Back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. pack,&#x201d; I gasped.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get it now!&#x201d; said Nevrescu. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t let him die. At least not yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>The massive man rushed back to the truck and grabbed my backpack. Since my hands were still tied behind my back he just dumped everything onto the table and I pointed at the inhaler with my head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Squeeze,&#x201d; I gasped.<br> <br>He held it up to my mouth and pressed down while I sucked in a lungful of mist.<br> <br>&#x201c;Again,&#x201d; I said, my voice returning to somewhat normal.<br> <br>He squeezed a second time and I sucked down some more mist.<br> <br>You&#x2019;ve got to hand it to the FBI. It looked and worked just like an actual inhaler. You&#x2019;d never guess it was really a panic button.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; I said with a huge sigh of relief. &#x201c;You just saved my life.&#x201d;<br> <br>Help was on the way. Now I only had to drag things out until it arrived.<br> <br>Nevrescu sat down across the table from me and started to look through the papers strewn across the table. I don&#x2019;t know what ruthless crime lords are supposed to look like, but he looked more businesslike than I expected. His hair was cut stylishly, short on the sides, but a little thicker on top. He had a neatly trimmed beard and mustache and intense blue eyes. He also spoke with an accent, but his English was perfect.<br> <br>&#x201c;Florian Bates,&#x201d; he said, reading my name off the top of some homework. &#x201c;You are the one the FBI only talks about in whispers. The one they call Little Sherlock.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I have no idea what you&#x2019;re talking about,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>He gave me a disappointed look. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not play games. I know who you are, and you know who I am.&#x201d;<br> <br>I nodded reluctantly. &#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re the man who masterminded the robbery at the National Gallery of Art.&#x201d;<br> <br>He chuckled. &#x201c;Mastermind? I love that word. I wish it were true. No, that fact you have wrong. That&#x2019;s why I had you brought here. So we could set the record straight and you could tell your friends at the FBI they are looking for the wrong person.&#x201d;<br> <br>He started to roll up his sleeves and I could see the collection of tattoos on his forearms. One was a red-and-black eel that I recognized as the symbol of the Eastern European League, a crime sy...</p><h2>The Storm (The NUMA Files)</h2><p><b>When the incomplete invention of a genius environmentalist falls into the wrong hands, it&#x2019;s the NUMA crew that will be the first casualties of war, and team leader Kurt Austin will stop at nothing to get justice for his fellow agents in this #1 <i>New York Times-</i>bestselling series.<br></b><br> In the middle of the Indian Ocean, a NUMA research vessel is taking water samples at sunset, when a crew member spots the familiar sheen of black oil ahead of them.

A pilot and an attorney, he lives in Arizona.<b>Prologue</b><p></p><p><b>Indian Ocean September 1943</b></p><p>The S.S. John Bury shuddered from bow to stern as it plowed through the rolling waters of the Indian Ocean. She was known as a &#x201c;fast freighter,&#x201d; designed to accompany warships and used to traveling at a decent clip, but with all boilers going full out the <i>John Bury</i> was moving at a pace she hadn&#x2019;t seen since her sea trials. Damaged, burning, and trailing smoke, the <i>John Bury</i> was running for her life.</p><p>The ship crested a ten-foot wave, the deck pitched down and the bow dug into another swell. A wide swath of spray kicked up over the rail and whipped back across the deck, rattling what was left of the shattered bridge.</p><p>Topside, the <i>John Bury</i> was a mangled wreck. Smoke poured from twisted metal where rockets had pounded the superstructure. Debris littered the deck, and dead crewmen lay everywhere.</p><p>But the damage was above the waterline, and the fleeing ship would survive if it avoided any more hits.</p><p>On the dark horizon behind, smoke poured from other vessels that had been less fortunate. An orange fireball erupted from one, flashing across the water and briefly illuminating the carnage.</p><p>The burning hulks of four ships could be seen, three destroyers and a cruiser, ships that had been the <i>John Bury&#x2019;s</i> escort. A Japanese submarine and a squadron of dive-bombers had found them simultaneously. As dusk approached, oil burned around the sinking vessels in a mile-long slick. It fouled the sky with dense black smoke. None of them would see the dawn.</p><p>The warships had been targeted and destroyed quickly, but the <i>John Bury</i> had only been strafed, hit with rockets and left to run free. There could be only one reason for that mercy; the Japanese knew of the top secret cargo she carried and they wanted it for themselves.</p><p>Captain Alan Pickett was determined not to let that happen, even with half his crew dead and his face gashed by shrapnel. He grabbed the voice tube and shouted down to the engine room.</p><p>&#x201c;More speed!&#x201d; he demanded.</p><p>There was no response. At last report a fire had been raging belowdecks. Pickett had ordered his men to stay and fight it, but now the silence left him gripped with fear.</p><p>&#x201c;Zekes off the port bow!&#x201d; a lookout called from the bridge wing. &#x201c;Two thousand feet and dropping.&#x201d;</p><p>Pickett glanced through the shattered glass in front of him. In the failing light he saw four black dots wheeling in the gray sky and dropping toward the ship. Flashes lit from their wings.</p><p>&#x201c;Get down!&#x201d; he shouted.</p><p>Too late. Fifty caliber shells stitched a line across the ship, cutting the lookout in half and blasting apart what was left of the bridge. Shards of wood, glass and steel flew about the compartment.</p><p>Pickett hit the deck. A wave of heat flashed over the bridge as another rocket hit ahead of it. The impact rocked the ship, peeling back the metal ceiling like a giant can opener.</p><p>As the wave of destruction passed, Pickett looked up. The last of his officers lay dead, the bridge was demolished. Even the ship&#x2019;s wheel was gone, with only a stub of metal still attached to the spindle. Yet somehow the vessel chugged on.</p><p>As Pickett climbed back up, he spotted something that gave him hope: dark clouds and sweeping bands of rain. A squall line was moving in fast off the starboard bow. If he could get his ship into it, the coming darkness would hide him.</p><p>Holding on to the bulkhead for support, he reached for what remained of the wheel. He pushed with all the strength he had left. It moved half a turn, and he fell to the ground holding it.</p><p>The ship began to change course.</p><p>Pressing against the deck, he pushed the wheel upward and then brought it back down again for another full revolution.</p><p>The freighter was leaning into the turn now, drawing a curved white wake on the ocean&#x2019;s surface, coming around toward the squall.</p><p>The clouds ahead were thick. The rain falling from them was sweeping the surface like a giant broom. For the first time since the attack began, Pickett felt they had a chance, but as the ship plowed toward the squall the awful sound of the dive-bombers turning and plunging toward him again put that in doubt.</p><p>He searched through the ship&#x2019;s gaping wounds for the source of that noise.</p><p>Dropping from the sky directly in front of him were two Aichi D3A dive-bombers, Vals, the same type the Japanese had used with deadly effect at Pearl Harbor and months later against the British fleet near Ceylon.</p><p>Pickett watched them nose over and listened as the whistling sound of their wings grew louder. He cursed at them and pulled his sidearm.</p><p>&#x201c;Get away from my ship!&#x201d; he shouted, blasting at them with the Colt .45.</p><p>They pulled up at the last minute and roared past, riddling the ship with another spread of .50 caliber shells. Pickett fell back onto the deck, a shell clean through his leg, shattering it. His eyes opened, gazing upward. He was unable to move.</p><p>Waves of smoke and gray sky rolled above him. He was finished, he thought. The ship and its secret cargo would soon fall into enemy hands.</p><p>Pickett cursed himself for not scuttling the ship. He hoped it would somehow go down on its own before it could be boarded.</p><p>As his eyesight began to fail, the sound of more dive-bombers caught his ear. The roar grew louder, the banshee scream from their wings calling out and announcing the terrible inevitability of the end.</p><p>And then the sky above darkened. The air turned cold and wet, and the S.S. <i>John Bury</i> disappeared into the storm, swallowed up by a wall of mist and rain.</p><p>She was last reported by a Japanese pilot as burning but sailing under full power. She was never seen or heard from again.</p><p></p><p></p><b>Chapter One</b><p></p><p><b>Northern Yemen, near the Saudi border August 1967</b></p><p>Tariq al-Khalif hid his face behind a cloth of soft white cotton. The kaffiyeh covered his head and wrapped around his mouth and nose. It kept the sun, wind and sand from his weather-beaten features as it hid him from the world.</p><p>Only Khalif&#x2019;s eyes showed, hard and sharp from sixty years in the desert. They did not blink or turn away as he stared at the dead bodies in the sand before him.</p><p>Eight bodies in all. Two men, three women, three children; stripped naked, all clothes and belongings gone. Most had been shot, a few had been stabbed.</p><p>As the camel train at Khalif&#x2019;s back waited, a rider moved slowly up toward him. Khalif recognized the strong, young figure in the saddle. A man named Sabah, his most trusted lieutenant. A Russian-made AK-47 lay slung over his shoulder.</p><p>&#x201c;Bandits for certain,&#x201d; Sabah said. &#x201c;No sign of them now.&#x201d;</p><p>Khalif studied the rough sand at his feet. He noticed the tracks disappearing to the west, headed directly toward the only source of water for a hundred miles, an oasis called Abi Quzza&#x2014;the &#x201c;silken water.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, my friend,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;These men are not waiting around to be discovered. They hide their numbers by sticking to the hard ground, where no tracks are left, or they walk on the softest sand, where the marks soon fade. But here I can see the truth, they&#x2019;re heading toward our home.&#x201d;</p><p>Abi Quzza had belonged to Khalif&#x2019;s family for generations. It provided life-giving water and a modicum of wealth. Date palms grew in abundance around its fertile springs, along with grass for the sheep and camels.</p><p>With the growing number of trucks and other forms of modern transportation, the caravans that paid for its gifts had begun to dwindle, and the role of camel-raising Bedouins like Khalif and his family were fading along with them, but they were not yet gone. For the clan to have any prospects at all, Khalif knew the oasis must be protected.</p><p>&#x201c;Your sons will defend it,&#x201d; Sabah said.</p><p>The oasis lay twenty miles to the west. Khalif&#x2019;s sons, two nephews and their families waited there. A half dozen tents, ten men with rifles. It would not be an easy place to attack. And yet Khalif felt a terrible unease.</p><p>&#x201c;We must hurry,&#x201d; he said, climbing back onto his camel.</p><p>Sabah nodded. He slid the AK-47 forward to a more aggressive position and nudged his camel forward.</p><p>Three hours later they approached the oasis. From a distance they could see nothing but small fires. There were no signs of struggle, no ripped tents or stray animals, no bodies lying in the sand.</p><p>Khalif ordered the camel train to a halt and dismounted. He took Sabah and two others, moving forward on foot.</p><p>The silence around them was so complete, they could hear the crackle of wood in the fires and their own feet scuffling in the sand. Somewhere in the distance, a jackal began to yelp. It was a long way off, but the noise carried in the desert.</p><p>Khalif halted, waiting for the jackal&#x2019;s call to fade. When it died away, a more pleasant sound followed: a small voice singing a traditional Bedouin melody. It came from the main tent and fl owed quietly.</p><p>Khalif began to relax. It was the voice of his youngest son, Jinn.</p><p>&#x201c;Bring the caravan,&#x201d; Khalif said. &#x201c;All is well.&#x201d;</p><p>As Sabah and the others went back to the camels, Khalif walked forward. He reached his tent, threw open the flap, and froze.</p><p>A bandit dressed in rags stood there, holding a curved blade to his son&#x2019;s throat. Another bandit sat beside him, clutching an old rifle.</p><p>&#x201c;One move and I slice his neck,&#x201d; the bandit said.</p><p>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am Masiq,&#x201d; the bandit said.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; Khalif asked.</p><p>Masiq shrugged. &#x201c;What don&#x2019;t we want?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The camels have value,&#x201d; Khalif said, guessing what they were after. &#x201c;I will give them to you. Just spare my family.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your offer is meaningless to me,&#x201d; Masiq replied, his face twisting into a snarl of contempt. &#x201c;Because I can take what I want, and because . . .&#x201d;&#x2014;he gripped the boy tightly&#x2014;&#x201c;except for this one, your family is already dead.&#x201d;</p><p>Khalif&#x2019;s heart tightened. Inside his tunic was a Webley- Fosbery automatic revolver. The self-cocking revolver was a sturdy weapon with deadly accuracy. It wouldn&#x2019;t jam even after months in the desert sand. He tried to think of a way to reach it.</p><p>&#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ll give you everything,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;just for him. And you can go free.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You have gold hidden here,&#x201d; Masiq said as if it were a known fact. &#x201c;Tell us where it is.&#x201d;</p><p>Khalif shook his head. &#x201c;I have no gold.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lies,&#x201d; the second bandit said.</p><p>Masiq began to laugh, his crooked teeth and decay-filled mouth making a horrific sound. Gripping the boy tightly with one arm, he raised the other as if to slice the boy&#x2019;s neck. But the child slipped loose, lunged for Masiq&#x2019;s fingers with his mouth and bit down hard.</p><p>Masiq cursed in pain. His hand snapped back as if he&#x2019;d been burned.</p><p>Khalif&#x2019;s own hand found the revolver and he blasted two shots right through his tunic. The would-be murderer fell backward, two smoking holes in his chest.</p><p>The second bandit fired, grazing Khalif&#x2019;s leg, but Khalif&#x2019;s shot hit him square in the face. The man fell without a word, but the battle had only just begun.</p><p>Outside the tent, gunfire began to echo through the night. Shots were being traded, volleys flying back and forth. Khalif recognized the sound of heavy bolt-action rifles, like the one in the dead thug&#x2019;s hand, they were answered by the rattling sound of Sabah and his automatic rifle.</p><p>Khalif grabbed his son, placing the pistol in the young boy&#x2019;s hand. He picked up the old rifle from beside one of the dead bandits. He plucked the curved knife from the ground as well and moved deeper into the tent.</p><p>His older sons lay there as if resting side by side. Their clothes were soaked with dark blood and riddled with holes.</p><p>A wave of pain swept over Khalif; pain and bitterness and anger.</p><p>With the gunfire raging outside, he stuck the knife into the side of the tent and cut a small hole. Peering through it, he saw the battle.</p><p>Sabah and three of the men were firing from behind a shield of dead camels. A group of thugs dressed like the bandits he&#x2019;d just killed were out in the oasis itself, hiding behind date palms in knee-high water.</p><p>There did not seem to be enough of them to have taken the camp by force.</p><p>He turned to Jinn. &#x201c;How did these men get here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They asked to stay,&#x201d; the boy said. &#x201c;We watered their camels.&#x201d;</p><p>That they&#x2019;d played on the tradition of Bedouin generosity and the kindness of Khalif&#x2019;s sons before killing them enraged Khalif further. He went to the other side of the tent. This time he plunged the knife into the fabric and drew it sharply downward.</p><p>&#x201c;Stay here,&#x201d; he ordered Jinn.</p><p>Khalif snuck through the opening and worked his way into the darkness. Moving in a wide arc, he curled in behind his enemies and slipped into the oasis.</p><p>Preoccupied with Sabah and his men at their front, the bandits never noticed Khalif flanking them. He came up behind them and opened fire, blasting them in the back from close range.</p><p>Three went down quickly and then a fourth. Another tried to run and was killed by a shot from Sabah, but the sixth and final thug turned around in time and fired back.</p><p>A slug hit Khalif&#x2019;s shoulder, knocking him backward and</p><p>sending a jolt of pain surging though his body. He landed in the water.</p><p>The bandit rushed toward him, perhaps thinking him dead or too wounded to fight.</p><p>Khalif aimed the old rifle and pulled the trigger. The shell jammed in the breach. He grabbed the bolt and worked to free it, but his wounded arm was not strong enough to break loose the frozen action.</p><p>The bandit raised his own weapon, drawing a bead on Khalif&#x2019;s chest. And then the sound of the Webley revolver rang out like thunder.</p><p>The bandit fell against a date palm with a puzzled look on his face. He slid down it, the weapon falling from his hands into the water.</p><p>Jinn stood behind the dead man, holding the pistol in a shaking grip, his eyes filled with tears.</p><p>Khalif looked around for more enemies, but he saw none. The shooting had stopped. He could hear Sabah shouting to the men. The battle was over.</p><p>&#x201c;Come here, Jinn,&#x201d; he ordered.</p><p>His son moved toward him, shaking and trembling. Khalif took him under one arm and held him.</p><p>&#x201c;Look at me.&#x201d;</p><p>The boy did not respond.</p><p>&#x201c;Look at me, Jinn!&#x201d;</p><p>Finally Jinn turned. Khalif held his shoulder tightly.</p><p>&#x201c;You are too young to understand, my son, but you have done a mighty thing. You have saved your father. You have saved your family.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But my brothers and mother are dead,&#x201d; Jinn cried.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Khalif said. &#x201c;They are in paradise, and we will go on, until we meet them one day.&#x201d;</p><p>Jinn did not react, he only stared and sobbed.</p><p>A sound from the right turned Khalif. One of the bandits was alive and trying to crawl away.</p><p>Khalif raised the curved knife, ready to finish the man, but then held himself back. &#x201c;Kill him, Jinn.&#x201d;</p><p>The shaking boy stared blankly. Khalif stared back, firm and unyielding.</p><p>&#x201c;Your brothers are dead, Jinn. The future of the clan rests with you. You must learn to be strong.&#x201d;</p><p>Jinn continued to shake, but Khalif was all the more certain now. Kindness and generosity had almost destroyed them.

Moral theology examines the same three truths. <i>The Christian Moral Life</i> is a handbook for moral theology that uses the theme of a journey to explain its key ethical concepts. First, humans begin with their creation in the image of God. Secondly, the goal of the journey is explained as a loving union with God, to achieve a share in his eternal happiness. Third and finally, the majority of the book examines how to attain this goal. Within the journey motif, the book covers the moral principles essential for attaining true happiness. Based on an examination of the moral methodology in the bible, the book discusses the importance of participating in divine nature through grace in order to attain eternal happiness. It further notes the role of law, virtue, and the gifts of the Holy Spirit in guiding and transforming humans into friends of God, who participate in his happiness. Following this section on moral theology in general, the book analyzes the individual virtues to give more concrete guidance. The entire project builds upon the insights of great Christian thinkers, such as Thomas Aquinas, Th�r�se of Lisieux, and John Paul II, to uncover the moral wisdom in scripture and to show people how to be truly happy both in this life and the next. This book will be of great interest to undergraduate students of moral theology, priests and seminarians, parents and teachers seeking to raise and to form happy children, and anyone interested in discovering the meaning of true happiness.</p><p>John Rziha is professor of theology at Benedictine College and author of <i>Perfecting Human Actions: St. Thomas Aquinas on Human Participation in Eternal Law</i>.&#x201c;<i>The Christian Moral Life</i> provides a necessary corrective to the popular misperception of Christian morality as nothing more than a system of oppressive rules that impair human freedom. He methodically sets forth the Christian moral life in all its splendor as nothing less than our grace-filled journey to personal fulfillment and eternal happiness, drawing upon scripture and the timeless wisdom of the saints. We used an earlier version of this text in our permanent diaconate program, and the students found it eminently readable and enlightening.&#x201d; (Leon Suprenant, Archdiocese of Kansas City, Kansas)<br><br>"John Rziha's book satisfies the long-awaited hope for a suitable textbook for students and professors of moral theology that is both robustly Catholic and rigorously academic from cover to cover. His copious work provides the framework and principles for a study that is both soundly Thomistic and refreshingly personalistic. This delightful text, laudably unencumbered by needless technical jargon, leads the reader to a fruitful contemplation and critical apprehension of the way toward genuine human beatitude in Christ by way of grace, virtue, and law. More than merely a suitable textbook, Dr. Rziha's book exemplifies true Christian and Catholic humanism at its finest. As such, this text ought to be standard fare for all students and professors of Catholic theology&#x2015;not only those whose work directly treats of the moral life in Christ." (Michael G. Sirilla, Franciscan University of Steubenville)<br><br>&#x201c;What is unique about <i>The Christian Moral Life</i> is that it at once offers a comprehensive treatment of moral theology with the necessary background in theological anthropology, takes an approach based in the virtues, beatitudes, and gifts of the Holy Spirit, and also treats the numerous elements of the law pertinent to the virtues.&#x201d; Christopher J. Malloy, University of Dallas (Christopher J. Malloy, University of Dallas)<br><br>&#x201c;Rziha always writes in accessible language to convey deep philosophical and theological ideas to the uninitiated. . . . <i>The Christian Moral Life</i> is a sound introductory textbook on the complexities of moral theology.&#x201d; (<i>Catholic Library World</i>)</p><h2>Despereaux (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Despereaux is very different from all the other mice in the castle.

From the day he joined the British Army to fight a colonial war in Rhodesia, where he met American Special Forces&#x2019; officer Dan Hill who would become his best friend, to the day he fell in love with Susan, everything in his remarkable life was preparing him for an act of generosity that would transcend all that went before. <br><br><i>Heart of a Soldier</i> is a story of bravery under fire, of loyalty to one&#x2019;s comrades, of the miracle of finding happiness late in life. Everything about Rick&#x2019;s life came together on September 11. In charge of security for Morgan Stanley, he successfully got all its 2,700 men and women out of the south tower of the World Trade Center. Then, thinking perhaps of soldiers he&#x2019;d held as they died, as well as the woman he loved, he went back one last time to search for stragglers.</p><p>James B. Stewart is the author of <i>Heart of a Soldier</i>, the bestselling <i>Blind Eye</i> and <i>Blood Sport</i>, and the blockbuster <i>Den of Thieves</i>. A former Page-One editor at <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, Stewart won a Pulitzer Prize in 1988 for his reporting on the stock market crash and insider trading. He is a regular contributor to <i>SmartMoney</i> and <i>The New Yorker.</i> He lives in New York.Stewart tells the extraordinary story of Rick Rescorla, chief of security for Morgan Stanley, who personally got 2,700 of the company's employees out of the South Tower on September 11. A decorated soldier, he believed that Osama bin Laden would attack the World Trade Center a second time. Although he did not survive that attack, he is an inspiration for many. George DiCenzo's reading is flawless, capturing Rescorla's passion with a spirit that does justice to Stewart's literary magic. He superbly conveys Rescorla's zeal to protect his employ-ees. DiCenzo particularly excels during passages that focus on Rescorla's love for his wife, Susan.

She spent several years learning about cheese making in Switzerland, then returned to Canada, where she is now the head cheese maker of The Farm House Natural Cheeses. </p><p><b>Introduction</b></p> <p>"A BOOK OF VERSES underneath the Bough, a Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread -- and Thou.... " This well known quote comes from one of the most famous romantics of all time, but what is missing from this picnic in paradise? The cheese, of course! While not mentioned in the poem, it is quite possible that cheese was on the menu that day. When Omar Khayy�m penned these words more than 800 years ago, cheese was already a staple food.</p> <p>Though the origin of cheese, like that of so many things in human history, is shrouded in mystery, it is safe to say that people of many cultures and traditions found ways early on to preserve the bounty and goodness of fresh milk, whether from cow, sheep, goat or camel, in this form. However it came to be, cheese is a valuable food: packed with important nutrients and a vital staple in the diets of most cultures.</p> <p>In traditional agriculture, cheese making was a way of preserving the summer's milk surplus for consumption in the leaner winter season, when the animals were awaiting the arrival of their young in the spring. Domesticated milk-producing animals have a period during which they are "dry," or not lactating, while their bodies store energy for the birth of their young. Since this phase can last from a few weeks up to several months, depending on the breed of animal, it was important to be prepared for that interval of no milk production. In the summer months, the farmer's wife would often become a cheese maker, filling the cellar with enough cheese for the family's own needs and producing a bit extra to sell at the market to supplement the farm income in the winter.</p> <p>The making of cheese on the farm was, and to some extent still is, an important part of many Old World cultures, but it was not continued to the same degree in the New World. However, things are changing. In the last 20 years or so, there has been a rediscovery of farmstead, or artisanal, cheese making, thanks to consumers who are actively seeking a more local, natural diet as an alternative to an increasingly industrialized and globalized food industry.</p> <p>My personal story of cheese making began in 1978 with a trip to the Swiss Alps. I was attending a wedding, and the bride's parents invited me to spend several days with them at their holiday chalet in the mountains. While there, we visited a <i>Senn,</i> or Alpine herdsman, who was in charge of the farmers' cows on the summer pasture. I remember the copper cauldron hanging over the wood fire in a low-ceilinged hut and the fresh cheeses draining on the boards along the walls. Right on the other side of the stone wall were the cows, back in their stalls for the evening milking after a day of grazing the Alpine meadows. After I returned to Canada, I tried my hand at cheese making, but my information was sketchy and I failed dismally. The long-suffering barn cats finished off what was left of my inedible cheese, and I shelved the idea. But destiny had other plans for me: several years later I returned to the Swiss Alps to live and raise a family, and there began again to learn the satisfying art of cheese making.</p> <p>This book will help you discover a bit of this cheese-making heritage for yourself, at home in your own kitchen. Some of the recipes are time-tested ones that your great-grandmother could very likely have made in her farm kitchen, while others have been collected from around the world. There are also some new ideas to try, with unusual ingredients. We will cover everything from simple fresh cheeses and related dairy products (such as butter, cr�me fra�che and ricotta) to traditional hard cheeses (such as Cheddar, Gruyere and Parmesan) to special ethnic cheeses.</p> <p>I hope you enjoy the process, but most of all the result. There's nothing like a fresh pizza on which even the mozzarella is made from scratch. Be sure to take some along on that perfect picnic!</p> <p>A note on <i>Appellation d'origine contr�l�e</i> (AOC) and <i>Denominazione di origine controllata</i> (DOC) cheeses: like fine wines, many cheeses are traditional to certain areas of the world and are made according to clearly outlined specifications to maintain their authenticity. In this book, we will be speaking of cheeses made in the style of many of these specialty cheeses.</p></p><h2>A Child&#39;s Anthology of Poetry</h2><p><p>A&nbsp;timeless collection celebrating the joys of poetry for children of all ages&#x2014;an indispensable introduction to literature and life that brings together essential classic children's poems with the best of modern and contemporary international poetry.</p><p>The simple pleasures of reading and listening to poetry can make unforgettable memories in childhood and help children develop an interest in language and storytelling.

Casualties, COG personnel: 18 injured, no fatalities. Casualties, insurgents: 30 dead. (Injury data unavailable. No wounded detained.)<br> Vectes Naval Base, Navy of the Coalition of Ordered Governments, New Jacinto: first week of Storm, 15 a.e.<br><br> "Welcome to New Jacinto," said Chairman Prescott. "And welcome to the protection of the Coalition of Ordered Governments. May this new year be a new start for us all."<br><br> Hoffman had to hand it to Prescott; he could always manage to look as if whatever lie he was telling at the time was the holy truth. The two men stood on the jetty as the Gorasni container ship Paryk disembarked its human cargo, five hundred civilians from an independent republic that had still been officially at war with the Coalition until last month. They were part of the COG now, whether they liked it or not. Hoffman guessed that they didn't.<br><br> "They don't look in a party mood, Chairman," Hoffman said.<br><br> A statesmanlike half-smile was nailed to Prescott's face, probably more for the benefit of his local audience--a detachment of Gears, a medical team, some civilian representatives--than for the new arrivals.<br><br> "I hope it's disorientation and seasickness rather than a lack of gratitude," he said.<br><br> Hoffman eyed the procession, looking for potential troublemakers and wondering if any of the refugees spoke the language well enough to see the irony in the COG's title. Governments? There was only one government left, a city-sized administration on a remote island a week's sailing time from Tyrus. That was all that was left of a global civilization of billions after fifteen years of fighting the Locust.<br><br> But on a sunny day like this, not a typical Storm day at all, Vectes must have looked pretty good compared with the mainland. No grub had ever set foot here, and it showed. The Gorasni bastards should have been grateful. Safe haven and food in exchange for all that extra fuel they didn't need? It was a good deal.<br><br> "Maybe they just hate our guts." Hoffman tried to imagine the mind-set of a pipsqueak nation that ignored the Pendulum Wars cease-fire. That was some serious grudge-nursing. "It was their leader's idea to join us. I'm betting he didn't take a vote on it."<br><br> "Let's hope they think of it as a bring-a-bottle party."<br><br> The Gorasni certainly weren't arriving empty-handed to drain the COG's limited resources. They were surrendering their imulsion supplies--an operational offshore drilling platform--in exchange for a refuge. In a world burned to a wasteland, fuel and food were the two assets that meant there'd be a tomorrow. Hoffman wasn't crazy about the Indies and he was damned sure they weren't crazy about him, but these were desperate times.<br><br> Can't be too choosy about our neighbors. At least they're not Stranded. They're not killing us--yet.<br><br> A security detail of Gears lined the jetty, channeling the refugees to the reception team at an old storehouse that was built into the fortresslike walls. Hoffman glanced at the faces around him and wondered if any war could ever make you forget the one that preceded it. But the Vectes locals had never even seen a Locust. Their monsters were still the Indies, the old human enemy from an eighty-year war--the people landing on this jetty.<br><br> "Bastards." An elderly man from the Pelruan town council wore a chestful of Pendulum War medals on his threadbare jacket, including the Allfathers' Medal. No, he wasn't about to forget. "Can't forgive any of them. Least of all those who still aren't sorry for what they did."<br><br> Hoffman noted the campaign ribbons and chose his words carefully. It was hard to navigate that dividing line between mortal enemies one day and new allies the next. The name that made his bile rise wasn't Gorasnaya, though, so he could look at these Indies with a certain distance.<br><br> Should I? I know what they did. I know what the old guy means. But they weren't the only ones. We all did things we weren't proud of.<br><br> "They're Indies with plenty of fuel," Hoffman said at last, conscious of Prescott eavesdropping. The man could look engrossed in something but that slight tilt of the head said he was taking in everything within earshot. "Nobody's asking you to forgive. Just take their imulsion as war reparation."<br><br> The old man stared at Hoffman as if he was an ignorant kid rather than a fellow vet.<br><br> "My comrades died in a Gorasni forced labor camp." He tugged at his lapel so Hoffman could see a timeworn regimental pin with the trident badge of the Duke of Tollen's Regiment. "The Indies can shove their fuel up their ass."<br><br> "Mind my asking why you've come today?"<br><br> "Just wanted to see how they looked without a rifle in their hands," said the old man. He was probably in his seventies, maybe only ten or fifteen years older than Hoffman, but the border with old age always moved a few years ahead with each birthday. "Everyone needs to look their monsters in the eye. Right?"<br><br> And all monsters needed to acknowledge their guilt before forgiveness could begin. Gorasnaya hadn't even come close. Maybe that would never have been enough anyway.<br><br> "Right," said Hoffman.<br><br> The veteran turned his back on the stream of newcomers filing along the quay and hobbled away. The Gorasni weren't going to get a welcome parade from the townsfolk in the north of the island, that was for sure.<br><br> Prescott took one step back and bent his knees slightly to whisper to Hoffman. "Doesn't bode well, Victor."<br><br> "What did you expect?"<br><br> "It was a whole war ago. It's history now."<br><br> "Not here." While most of the world fried, Vectes had waited without much to distract it. The island had been cut off from the rest of the COG when the Hammer of Dawn was deployed, although whether it thought itself lucky now was another matter. "It's still yesterday for some of them."<br><br> "And you?"<br><br> "I never served on the eastern front," Hoffman said. He had his bad memories like any other Gear, but they had nothing to do with Gorasnaya. "I don't imagine some Indies have fond recollections of us, either."<br><br> Prescott inhaled slowly, eyes still on the procession of Gorasni. "I won't allow human society to rebuild ghettos, but let's be prudent. Keep the refugees apart from the rest of the civilians until we're absolutely sure that everyone's used to the idea. Like the rehabilitated."<br><br> "Is that what we're calling them now?" Hoffman had now had a bellyful of euphemisms. "Let me strike the word Stranded from my operational vocabulary, then. I thought we were keeping the rehabilitated ones separate for opsec reasons so they didn't tip off their unrehabilitated buddies about our patrols."<br><br> If Hoffman's irritable lack of deference irked Prescott, the man didn't let it show. In fact, the slimeball smirked. "Who says a certain caution about the Gorasni refugees isn't for operational security too?"<br><br> Refugees was an ironic term. Everyone on Vectes--except the native islanders--had fled from Old Jacinto only months earlier. Lines were drawn fast in this new post-Locust world. Hoffman glanced up the jetty to watch three Pelruan councilmen talking in a tight knot, one of them far too young to have served in the Pendulum Wars anyway. So were a lot of the Gorasni. That didn't mean they hadn't inherited opinions from those who weren't.<br><br> Nobody's ever seen more than a few months of peace. Any of us. How long does it take people to forget? Or do we never manage to?<br><br> "Trescu's going to keep his people in line, and so will we," Hoffman said at last. He didn't like the look of a couple of the men disembarking, in particular the way their jackets hung as if draped over something bulky underneath. Gorasnaya might have been relaxed about arming civvies, but the COG wasn't. They'd have to deal with that, diplomatically or not. "It's all about keeping folks fed and busy."<br><br> "The voice of experience."<br><br> And you know where I acquired it, don't you, asshole? "Nothing's more trouble than hungry, bored people."<br><br> "Where is Trescu?"<br><br> "With Michaelson, working out tanker rosters."<br><br> "Good." Prescott lost interest in the refugees right on cue. He checked his watch and took a couple of steps up the jetty in the direction of his office. "I want a permanent detachment of Gears on that rig. Can't be too careful."<br><br> "Already in hand, Chairman. I'm putting Fenix and Santiago on it. They're heading out shortly to do a security assessment."<br><br> "Wouldn't they be better tasked rooting out the Stranded? We can destroy a Locust army, but suddenly we can't eradicate a few hundred half-starved vagrants."<br><br> "I know who my best problem-solvers are, Chairman." And I'm the frigging chief of staff here. I decide how I deploy my men. Hoffman ignored the sly criticism. "That imulsion platform is going to be a bigger problem than pest control."<br><br> Prescott gave him a brief frown but didn't ask for an explanation. It didn't take a genius to work it out anyway. Gorasnaya couldn't protect that damn rig--or maintain it--without having to crawl to the COG for help. It was going to tie up COG resources. But the COG needed the imulsion to keep the fleet running, build a city, and drag this damn place out of the last century.<br><br> Prescott gave Hoffman his best statesman's public relations smile--no display of teeth, just a curl of the lips. "I have absolute faith in you, Colonel. We would never have survived this far without your leadership. I look forward to the report."</p><h2>Story of O Return to the Chateau</h2><p>&#34;The Return to the Chateau: Story of O&#34; is widely acknowledged to be one of the most famous erotic novels of all time.

Professional historians continue to argue over the meaning of the term. This book challenges the view of historiography as an esoteric subject by presenting an accessible and concise overview of the history of historical writing from the Renaissance to the present. Historiography plays an integral role in aiding undergraduate students to better understand the nature and purpose of historical analysis more generally by examining the many conflicting ways that historians have defined and approached history. By demonstrating how these historians have differed in both their interpretations of specific historical events and their definitions of history itself, this book conveys to students the interpretive character of history as a discipline and the way that the historian&#39;s context and subjective perspective influence his or her understanding of the past.</p><p>The essential primer on the complexities of history writing, and writing history.<p>Eileen Cheng is Associate Professor in the History Faculty at Sarah Lawrence College.

Round as in stout, chubby, and always hungry. His relationship with eating was difficult and his struggle with it began early. When named the restaurant critic for <i>The New York Times</i> in 2004, he knew he would be performing one of the most watched tasks in the epicurean universe. And with food his friend and enemy both, his jitters focused primarily on whether he'd finally made some sense of that relationship. A captivating story of his unpredictable journalistic odyssey as well as his lifelong love-hate affair with food, <i>Born Round</i> will speak to everyone who's ever had to rein in an appetite to avoid letting out a waistband.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, August 2009:</strong> How a man with a lifelong battle of the bulge landed the job as the restaurant critic for the <i>New York Times</i>, the most influential job in the food world, is only half the story (more like a third, really) in Frank Bruni's brave, brutally honest, often hilarious, and truly endearing memoir, <i>Born Round: The Secret History of a Full-Time Eater</i>. <br><br> Bruni struggled with over-eating since he was a boy growing up in a food-focused family in White Plains, NY. From adolescence through adulthood, Bruni was on the losing side of maintaining a healthy relationship with food, and eventually his inability to control his hunger--manifested in bulimia, convenience store binges, and bouts of sleep eating--defined his life. There aren't many books out there dealing with what it's like to be a man with an eating disorder. While Bruni's story is peppered with humor, his disgust at himself as he yo-yo's up to size 42 khakis at the Gap and endures years-long patches of celibacy leaves the reader aching in empathy. <br><br> Self-doubt about his appearance causes him to sabotage any chances at happiness as he makes lame excuses to postpone dates in the hopes that he'll drop those few extra pounds before he might have to reveal himself. And throughout the book he's banking on being slimmer in the future--whether it's a few days, weeks, or months--and sacrifices truly appreciating the present, even when he's holding prestigious jobs at Newsweek and the <i>New York Times.</i><br><br> <blockquote><i>"I was in retreat, my weight a reason not to reach out or take risks. I'd deal with my love life once I got thinner.... Fatness simplified life and lessened the stakes. It put life on hiatus, making the present a larded limbo between a past normalcy and a future one. It argued against bold initiatives.... But while I wasn't trying to make things happen, they nonetheless happened to me."</i></blockquote><br><br> There's a very funny account of how he worked with a photographer friend to digitally manipulate his author photo for <em>Ambling into History</em> in an attempt "to transform the round into the oblong, chubby into chiseled, gone-to-seed to come-to-Papa." When he saw the results of the final photo (the one that would be taped behind the reservation stand of many New York restaurants) his friend wondered: "When was the last time anyone at the publishing house saw you?"<br><br> And when he gets the tap to become restaurant critic and leaves his gig as the <i>Times</i>'s Rome bureau chief, he begins a preparatory world-tour of eating research before entering an exhausting career of eating out seven nights a week, juggling multiple dining identities (with matching AmEx cards), and becoming one of "the most loved and hated tastemakers in New York." <i>--Brad Thomas Parsons</i>Frank Bruni was named restaurant critic for <i>The New York Times</i> in April 2004. Before that he served as the newspaper&#x2019;s Rome bureau chief and as a White House correspondent. His 2002 book about George W. Bush, <i>Ambling into History</i>, was a <i>New York Times</i> best seller. He lives in New York City.</p><h2>Hannah&#39;s List: A Romance Novel (A Blossom Street Novel, 7)</h2><p><strong><em>My darling Michael,</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong><br><br><strong><em>I know this letter will come as a shock to you...</em></strong><br><br>On the anniversary of his beloved wife&#x2019;s death, Dr. Michael Everett receives a letter Hannah had written him.<br><br>In it she reminds him of her love and makes one final request.

I've been known to forget Mother's Day and, once, when Hannah and I were dating, I even let Valentine's go unnoticed. Fortunately she didn't take my lapse too seriously or see it as any reflection of my feelings. As for anniversaries and birthdays, I'm a lost cause. In fact, I'd probably overlook Christmas if it wasn't for all the hoopla. It's not that I'm self-absorbed... Well, maybe I am, but aren't we all to a certain extent?<br><br>To me, paying a lot of attention to people because it's their birthday or some made-up holiday is ridiculous. When you love someone, you need to show that love each and every day. Why wait for a certain time of year to bring your wife flowers? Action really does speak louder than words, especially if it's a loving deed, something you do for no particular reason. Except that you want to. Because you care.<br><br>Hannah taught me that. Hannah. A year ago today, May eighth, I lost her, my beautiful thirty-six-year-old wife. Even now, a whole year after her death, I can't think of her without my gut twisting into knots.<br><br>A year. Three hundred and sixty-five lonely days and empty nights.<br><br>A few days after her death, I stood over Hannah's casket and watched as it was lowered into the ground. I threw the first shovelful of dirt into her grave. I'll never forget that sound. The hollow sound of earth hitting the coffin's gleaming surface.<br><br>Not an hour passes that I don't remember Hannah. Actually, that's an improvement. In those first few months, I couldn't keep her out of my head for more than a minute. Everything I saw or heard reminded me of Hannah.<br><br>To simply say I loved her would diminish the depth of my feelings. In every way she completed me. Without her, my world is bleak and colorless and a thousand other adjectives that don't begin to describe the emptiness I've felt since she's been gone.<br><br>I talk to her constantly. I suppose I shouldn't tell people that. We've had this ongoing one-sided conversation from the moment she smiled up at me one last time and surrendered her spirit to God.<br><br>So, here I am a year later, pretending to enjoy the Seattle Mariners' baseball game when all I can think about is my wife. My one-year-dead wife.<br><br>Ritchie, Hannah's brother and my best friend, invited me to share box seats for this game. I'm not fooled. I'm well aware that my brother-in-law didn't include me out of some mistaken belief that I'm an inveterate baseball fan. He knows exactly what anniversary this is.<br><br>I might not be sentimental, but this is one day I <em>can't </em>forget.<br><br>As a physician, a pediatrician, I'm familiar with death. I've witnessed it far too often and it's never easy, especially with children. Even when the end is peaceful and serene as it was with Hannah, I feel I've been cheated, that I've lost.<br><br>As a teenager I was involved in sports. I played football in the fall, basketball in winter and baseball in the spring, and worked as a lifeguard during the summers. The competitive spirit is a natural part of who I am. I don't like to lose, and death, my adversary, doesn't play fair. Death took Hannah from me, from all of us, too early. She was the most vibrant, joyful, loving woman I have ever known. I've been floundering ever since.<br><br>Although I've fought death, my enemy, from the day I became a doctor&#x2014;it's <em>why </em>I became a doctor&#x2014;I learned to understand it in a different, more complex way. I learned death can be a friend even while it's the enemy. As she lay dying, Hannah, who loved me so completely and knew me so well, showed me that ultimate truth.<br><br>A year's time has given me the perspective to realize I did my wife a disservice. My biggest regret is that I refused to accept the fact that she was dying. As a result I held on to her far longer than I should have. I refused to relinquish her when she was ready to leave me. Selfishly, I couldn't bear to let her go.<br><br>Even when she'd drifted into unconsciousness I sat by her bedside night and day, unable to believe that there wouldn't be a miracle. It's stupid; as a medical professional I certainly know better. Yet I clung to her. Now I realize that my stubbornness, my unwillingness to release her to God, held back her spirit. Tied her to earth. To me.<br><br>When I recognized the futility of it all, when I saw what I was doing to Hannah's parents and to Ritchie, I knew I had to let her go. I left Hannah's room and got hold of myself. I hadn't slept in days, hadn't eaten. Nor had I shaved, which means I probably looked even more pathetic than I felt. I went back to our home, showered, forced down a bowl of soup and slept for three uninterrupted hours. When I returned, the immediate family had gathered around her bedside. Hannah's heart rate had slowed and it was only a matter of minutes. Then, just before she died, she opened her eyes, looked directly at me and smiled. I held her hand and raised it to my lips as she closed her eyes and was...gone.<br><br>That last smile will stay with me forever. Every night as I press my head against the pillow, the final image in my mind is Hannah's farewell smile.<br><br>"Hey, Michael. A beer?" Ritchie asked. He doesn't call me Mike; no one does. Even as a kid, I was never a Mike.<br><br>"Sure." My concentration wasn't on the game or on much of anything, really. Without glancing at the scoreboard I couldn't have told you who was ahead. I went through the motions, jumped to my feet whenever Ritchie did. I shouted and made noise along with the rest of the crowd, but I didn't care about the game. I hadn't cared about anything for a long time&#x2014;except my work. That had become my salvation.<br><br>"How about dinner after the game?" Ritchie asked as he handed me a cold beer a few minutes later.<br><br>I hesitated. All that awaited me was an empty house and my memories of Hannah.<br><br>"Sure." I didn't have much of an appetite, though. I rarely did these days.<br><br>"Great." He took a long swig of beer and turned back to the field.<br><br>I hadn't done my brother-in-law any favors by agreeing to attend this game. These weren't cheap seats, either. Ritchie had paid big bucks for box seats behind home plate, and I'd basically ignored the entire game.<br><br>I should've made an excuse and let him take someone else. But I didn't want to be alone. Not today. Every other day of the year I was perfectly content with my own company. But not today.<br><br>The game must have been over because, almost before I was aware of it, people were leaving.<br><br>"Great game," I said, making the effort.<br><br>"We lost," Ritchie muttered.<br><br>I hadn't been paying enough attention to notice.<br><br>Ritchie slapped me on the back and headed out of the stadium. That was his way of telling me he understood.<br><br>Half an hour later we sat in a friendly sports bar not far from Safeco Field. I stared at the menu, wishing I could conjure up an appetite. Over the past year I'd lost nearly twenty pounds. Food was a necessity, and that was the only reason I bothered. I usually ate on the run, without interest or forethought. I needed something in my belly so I grabbed a protein bar or a vegetable drink. It served the purpose, although I derived no pleasure from it.<br><br>Hannah had been exceptionally talented in the kitchen, just like her cousin Winter Adams, who owned the French Cafe on Blossom Street. She loved experimenting with recipes and took pride in preparing meals. Hannah's dinner parties were legendary among our friends. As a hostess, she was a natural&#x2014;charming and gracious.<br><br>"What are you thinking about?" Ritchie asked.<br><br>His question startled me until I saw that he was gazing at the menu. "Grilled salmon," I replied.<br><br>"I'm leaning toward the T-bone," he said.<br><br>I've always associated steaks with celebration, and this wasn't a day I'd consider celebrating. Long before I was willing to accept that Hannah had lost her battle with cancer, she'd told me that when she was gone, she didn't want me to grieve. She said her wake should be as much fun as her parties. At the time I didn't want to hear her talk about death. By then she'd resigned herself to the outcome; I hadn't found the courage to do so.<br><br>The waitress took our order, brought us each a beer and left. I held the amber bottle between my fingers and frowned at the table. I wished I was better company for Ritchie.<br><br>"It's been a year," my brother-in-law murmured. I nodded, acknowledging the comment, but not elaborating on it. "I miss her."<br><br>Again I nodded. As painful as it was to talk about Hannah, I had the burning desire to do exactly that. I wanted&#x2014;no, needed&#x2014;to hold on to her, if not physically, then emotionally.<br><br>"Hard to believe it's been twelve months." I heard the pain in my own voice but didn't try to hide it.<br><br>"You doing okay?" Ritchie asked.<br><br>I shrugged rather than tell the truth&#x2014;I wasn't okay. I was damn mad. Still. How <em>dared </em>this happen to a woman as wonderful as Hannah. How dared it happen to me!<br><br>Hannah and I were married as soon as I graduated from medical school. We decided that my internship and residency would be too demanding to allow us to start a family right away. Hannah worked for a regional department-store chain as a buyer and loved her job. When I'd get home too exhausted to think, she'd entertain me with stories of the people she'd met. People whose names I soon forgot but whose foibles lived on. The smallest incident became a full-fledged anecdote, complete with wickedly funny observations. She had a way of making the most mundane details fascinating. If I close my eyes I can still hear her laugh. I can smile just recalling the early years of our marriage and the struggles we endured, the things we enjoyed. Memories sustained me that first year without Hannah.<br><br>The day I finished my residency and specialized training and was able to join a Seattle practice was the day Hannah threw away her birth control pills. We talked endlessly about our family. I love children and so did Hannah. She wanted three kids; I would've been satisfied with two. Hannah felt an odd number would be best, so I said yes to three.<br><br>But Hannah didn't get pregnant. We'd assumed it would be so easy. She worried constantly, and I was convinced the stress she felt was the real problem. After eighteen months she wanted to see a fertility specialist and I agreed. That was when we learned that getting Hannah pregnant was the very least of our concerns. Within a week of our first visit to the specialist, Hannah was diagnosed with stage-four ovarian cancer. By the time the discovery was made, it was too late to save her.<br><br>I couldn't help feeling I should have known, should have suspected that something wasn't right. As a medical professional, I blamed myself for the fact that Hannah went undiagnosed as long as she did. If I'd paid closer attention, I told myself, I might have picked up on the clues. I'd been busy, preoccupied with work. I had other things on my mind.<br><br>Friends have argued with me, friends like Patrick O'Malley, who's another pediatrician and one of my partners. They frequently reminded me&#x2014;as did Hannah herself&#x2014;that ovarian cancer is notoriously lacking in symptoms until it's too late. I knew all that. What I realized was that I <em>needed </em>to feel guilty, to punish myself; I think I felt better if I could blame myself for not noticing.<br><br>"Remember the night Steph and I had you and Hannah over for dinner?" Ritchie asked, breaking into my thoughts. "The last night?"<br><br>I nodded. It'd been a Friday evening, the final time we'd gone out as a couple. We'd received news that afternoon that had rocked our world. The latest test results had come in&#x2014;and they showed that the chemo had done little to slow the progression of the disease.<br><br>Devastated, I'd wanted to cancel dinner, but Hannah insisted we go. She'd put on a bright smile and walked into her brother and sister-in-law's home as though nothing was wrong. I was an emotional mess and barely made it through the evening. Not Hannah. If I hadn't known, I would never have guessed.<br><br>"Yeah, I remember."<br><br>"She asked me to do something for her that night," Ritchie went on to say.<br><br>"Hannah did?" Unable to hide my surprise, I looked up from my beer.<br><br>Now Ritchie glanced away. "While you were playing a video game with Max, Hannah spoke with me privately."<br><br>I moved to the edge of my seat. The noise from the television blaring above the bar seemed to fade into the background. Every muscle in my body tensed, almost as if I knew what Ritchie was about to tell me.<br><br>"She said the doctors had delivered bad news."<br><br>I focused on an empty bar stool on the other side of the room. "I wanted to cancel dinner. Hannah wouldn't let me."<br><br>"She had a good reason for wanting to come that night," Ritchie explained. "She told me there wasn't any hope left and she'd accepted that she was going to die."<br><br>I wasn't in the mood to hear this. Ritchie exhaled loudly. "She wasn't afraid of dying, you know."<br><br>"Why should she be? Heaven was made for people like Hannah."<br><br>Ritchie nodded, agreeing with me. "She'd made her peace with God long before that night. She never had a fatalistic attitude. She wanted to live. More than anything, she wanted to live."<br><br>At one time I'd doubted that. "I begged her to let me take her to Europe because I'd read about an experimental treatment there. She wouldn't go."<br><br>"It was too late," Ritchie said simply. His hand tightened around the beer bottle. "She knew it even if we didn't."<br><br>That was Hannah&#x2014;not only was she wise, but forever practical. While she was willing to accept the inevitable, I clung to every shred of hope. I spent hours studying medical journals, calling specialists, doing online research. But my crazed efforts to cure her didn't make any difference. In the end Hannah had been right; she'd reached the point of no return. She died less than two months later.<br><br>Even now I was shocked by how quickly she slipped away. It was the only time in our marriage that I became truly angry with her. I wanted Hannah to fight the cancer. I shouted and paced and slammed my fist against the wall. Gently she took my bleeding knuckles between her own hands and kissed away the pain. What she didn't seem to understand was that no amount of tenderness would ease the ache of her leaving me.<br><br></p><h2>Born Free: A Lioness of Two Worlds</h2><p>There have been many accounts of the return to the wild of tame animals, but since its original publication in 1960, when <i>T</i>he <i>New York Times</i> hailed it as a &#x201c;fascinating and remarkable book,&#x201d; <i>Born Free</i> has stood alone in its power to move us.<br><br>Joy Adamson's story of a lion cub in transition between the captivity in which she is raised and the fearsome wild to which she is returned captures the abilities of both humans and animals to cross the seemingly unbridgeable gap between their radically different worlds. Especially now, at a time when the sanctity of the wild and its inhabitants is increasingly threatened by human development and natural disaster, Adamson's remarkable tale is an idyll, and a model, to return to again and again.<br><br>Illustrated with the same beautiful, evocative photographs that first enchanted the world forty years ago and updated with a new introduction by George Page, former host and executive editor of the PBS series <i>Nature</i> and author of <i>Inside the Animal Mind,</i> this anniversary edition introduces to a new generation one of the most heartwarming associations between man and animal.</p><p>First published in 1960 and closely followed by a hit movie of the same name, Joy Adamson's now classic memoir <i>Born Free</i> continues to introduce countless young people to the wildlife of Africa. Adamson recounts her adventures as the surrogate mother of an orphaned lion cub named Elsa (with parenting duties shared by her husband George and by a delightfully imperturbable rock hyrax named Pati), whom she raised as a welcome member of her human and animal family while painstakingly teaching Elsa the skills she would need to survive in the wild. Her teaching, against all odds, was effective: three years later, the Adamsons took Elsa to a place near that of her birth and set her loose, hoping that she would find her "real pride" among other lions of the Kenya grasslands--as she soon did. <p> Long targeted to preteen readers, <i>Born Free</i> is in fact a sophisticated work of environmental consciousness-raising, for Joy Adamson believed that any relationship between humans and wild animals had to be conditioned by an attitude "of absolute equality quite different from that between a dog and his master." Although Elsa's story had an ultimately tragic ending--the young lioness died of disease and, in separate incidents, Joy and George Adamson were both murdered--Joy Adamson's book continues to instruct and entertain readers of all ages. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>JOY ADAMSON</b> was born in Austria in 1910 and educated in Vienna.

She lives in Los Angeles.Chapter 1<br><br>Warren&nbsp;the 13th tiptoed across the roof of the Warren Hotel,&nbsp;and the old slate tiles clattered like bones.&nbsp;A crisp autumn wind snapped at his back,&nbsp;threatening to knock him off balance, but&nbsp;he kept going. A fall from the top of an&nbsp;eight-story building was the least of his&nbsp;worries. He had a chimney to repair.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ravens screeched a warning from&nbsp;inside the smoke shaft but Warren peered&nbsp;down anyway. As usual, the chimney was&nbsp;clogged with newspapers, fabric scraps,&nbsp;twigs, branches, and other debris. Six black&nbsp;birds stared back, huddled together in a&nbsp;makeshift nest.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Go on now!&#x201d; Warren shouted.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ravens didn&#x2019;t budge.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;There are plenty of nice trees around&nbsp;here. Shoo!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But the ravens did not &#x201c;shoo.&#x201d; They&nbsp;seemed to be pretending that Warren was&nbsp;invisible.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I guess we&#x2019;ll have to do this the hard&nbsp;way,&#x201d; he said with a sigh.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Warren had performed this chore&nbsp;dozens of times. At least once or twice&nbsp;a month, he climbed up to the roof and&nbsp;cleared the nest from the chimney before&nbsp;it caused the entire hotel to fill with smoke.&nbsp;But this morning the ravens seemed particularly&nbsp;stubborn. Winter was coming, and&nbsp;they needed a cozy place to ride out the cold&nbsp;weather.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What if I poured water on you?&#x201d; Warren&nbsp;asked. &#x201c;How would you like that?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The birds knew he was bluffing. One&nbsp;snapped its beak, but the rest went right on&nbsp;dozing. So Warren creeped over to the ridge&nbsp;of the roof where a crooked weathervane&nbsp;stood. He unscrewed the sharp metal post&nbsp;and poked it inside the chimney. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll use&nbsp;force if I have to,&#x201d; he said with determination.&nbsp;&#x201c;Get out of there or else!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ravens didn&#x2019;t even ruffle a feather.&nbsp;They knew Warren was too nice to hit a bird&nbsp;with a weathervane.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was clear Warren had only one option&nbsp;left. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t leave now,&#x201d; he said with&nbsp;as much menace as he could muster, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go&nbsp;get Aunt Annaconda and then you&#x2019;ll have to&nbsp;deal with her.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ravens exploded from the chimney,&nbsp;squawking and scattering feathers as they&nbsp;rose into the sky. They had been around the&nbsp;hotel long enough to know all about Annaconda,&nbsp;and no one&#x2013;not even a raven&#x2013;dared to test her patience.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Warren watched until the birds were&nbsp;nothing but dark specks against the dawn&#x2019;s&nbsp;pale sky. He hated to frighten them, but&nbsp;they&#x2019;d left him no choice. His gaze lowered&nbsp;and he looked out from his spot high above&nbsp;the ground. The view was nothing special.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Warren Hotel was the only building&nbsp;for miles; perched miserably on a hill in a&nbsp;bleak gray countryside, it was ringed by a&nbsp;forest of equally bleak and withered trees.&nbsp;You could walk for hours in every direction&nbsp;without finding anything interesting.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But Warren wasn&#x2019;t looking at the&nbsp;depressing view. He was looking beyond&nbsp;it, past the horizon, to where the rest of&nbsp;the world existed. He imagined cities and&nbsp;jungles, seaports and deserts, landscapes&nbsp;he knew only from books. All places he&nbsp;would love to visit . . . were it not for the&nbsp;fact that he was twelve years old and heir&nbsp;to his family&#x2019;s hotel, where he worked as&nbsp;the sole bellhop, handyman, exterminator,&nbsp;room-service valet, and all-around errand&nbsp;boy. Warren the 13th had spent his whole&nbsp;life at the hotel, just as his father and eleven&nbsp;other Warrens had before him.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a sigh, he returned to the grim&nbsp;task of chimney cleaning. Soon his hands&nbsp;were black with soot. He yanked out dozens&nbsp;of sticks and branches and a handful of&nbsp;stranger, more unexpected objects: a lady&#x2019;s&nbsp;lace bonnet, a rusty nail file, a pie pan, even&nbsp;a bag of marbles he recognized as his own.&nbsp;Warren was trying to figure out how the&nbsp;ravens could have retrieved a bag of marbles&nbsp;from the desk drawer in his attic room when&nbsp;a low growling noise caught his attention.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Warren squinted into the early-morning&nbsp;fog. To his astonishment, he saw movement&nbsp;in the forest. Concealed by a canopy&nbsp;of spindly branches, a large dark shape&nbsp;was weaving through the trees. The woods&nbsp;around the hotel teemed with bears and&nbsp;wild boars, but this shape was larger than&nbsp;any animal. It growled again, and Warren&#x2019;s&nbsp;heart gave a leap. This was no ordinary&nbsp;creature.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was an automobile!<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He hadn&#x2019;t seen an automobile since the&nbsp;last guest exited the Warren Hotel, vowing&nbsp;never to return. Five long years had passed&nbsp;without a single customer. Warren&#x2019;s eyes&nbsp;grew large as the automobile crested the&nbsp;hill. At last, someone was coming to stay&nbsp;with them!<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The car passed through the once-grand&nbsp;iron gates and slowed to a stop at the front&nbsp;doors of the Warren Hotel. And that&#x2019;s&nbsp;precisely when Warren remembered it was&nbsp;his job to greet new arrivals and help withtheir bags.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He winced as the hotel intercom sputtered&nbsp;to life&#x2013;its tinny sound echoing inside&nbsp;the chimney shaft&#x2013;with his uncle Rupert&#x2019;s&nbsp;panicked voice ringing through the static:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;WAAAAARREN!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had to get to the lobby right away!&nbsp;Warren considered using the chimney as&nbsp;a shortcut, but eight stories was a long way&nbsp;down. Instead, he leapt off the side of the&nbsp;roof, grabbed a rain gutter with one hand,&nbsp;and swung through a window in the attic.&nbsp;He landed with a thump, sprinkling soot all&nbsp;over the small bed and desk that crowded&nbsp;his tiny room.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Warren used to sleep in one of the large&nbsp;bedrooms on the hotel&#x2019;s second floor, but&nbsp;Aunt Annaconda didn't like having children&nbsp;around and wanted him out of her way. She&nbsp;banished him to the hotel&#x2019;s topmost floor,&nbsp;eight floors away from the lobby where&nbsp;Warren did most of his work.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dashing to a spot on the floor of his&nbsp;room, Warren raised a trap door, climbed&nbsp;down a wooden ladder, and landed with a&nbsp;thump inside the eighth-floor hallway. He&nbsp;picked himself up and ran to the main stairwell,&nbsp;his mind abuzz with possibilities. Who&nbsp;was this mystery guest? And why had this&nbsp;person come to his hotel?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Things had been much different when&nbsp;Warren was little. Back then, the hotel was&nbsp;booked months in advance. Grand automobiles&nbsp;paraded along the driveway all night&nbsp;long; guests arrived in style&#x2013;men wearing&nbsp;tuxedos and top hats, ladies bedecked in&nbsp;gowns and jewels and pearls. A dozen bellhops&nbsp;in crisp matching uniforms greeted&nbsp;each new arrival, transferring luggage to&nbsp;polished brass carts while butlers swept by&nbsp;with trays of lemonade and cookies. In those&nbsp;days, the hotel had an enormous staff devoted&nbsp;to keeping everything in tip-top shape.&nbsp;Hedges were clipped, carpets were vacuumed,&nbsp;furniture was dusted, and wallpaper was&nbsp;scrubbed. A troop of maids stretched fresh&nbsp;linens across soft mattresses, and tall vases&nbsp;of fresh flowers brightened every corner.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But that was long ago, when Warren the&nbsp;12th was still in charge. He died when Warren&nbsp;the 13th was just seven, too young to take&nbsp;over such a big hotel. Instead, his uncle&nbsp;Rupert had stepped in to fill the job. Unfortunately,&nbsp;Rupert was lazy and disliked work,&nbsp;which meant that things went downhill fast.&nbsp;The staff quit. The lawns became overrun&nbsp;with weeds. Guests cut their vacations short,&nbsp;then stopped coming altogether. Within&nbsp;a year most of the rooms were vacant, and&nbsp;they had remained so ever since.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now the hotel looked more like a&nbsp;haunted house than a vacation destination.&nbsp;Once-shiny windowpanes were cracked&nbsp;or broken; shutters hung crookedly, and&nbsp;the whole building was in desperate need&nbsp;of paint. The interior wasn&#x2019;t much better.&nbsp;Faded wallpaper was peeling at the seams.&nbsp;Faucets dripped, hinges creaked, floorboards&nbsp;squeaked. No one had used the game&nbsp;room or the tearoom or any of the other&nbsp;common rooms in ages. The pool table was&nbsp;covered in dust. The furniture was shrouded&nbsp;beneath musty old sheets, turning tables&nbsp;and chairs into squat little ghosts.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;WAAAAARREEENN!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Again Uncle Rupert&#x2019;s voice wailed&nbsp;through the intercom, jolting Warren from&nbsp;his daydreams. He set aside his memories&nbsp;and ran even faster down the winding staircase,&nbsp;leaping over the one-hundred-and-third&nbsp;step (since it was, in fact, missing)&nbsp;and narrowly avoiding the hotel snail&nbsp;lurching across the fourth-floor landing.&nbsp;He descended the last two flights by sliding&nbsp;along the bannister and then skidded,&nbsp;breathless, onto the chipped checkerboard&nbsp;marble floor of the lobby.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Uncle Rupert stood near a window,&nbsp;peering through the curtains and slicking&nbsp;back his hair. &#x201c;Th-there&#x2019;s a car in the&nbsp;driveway!&#x201d; he sputtered.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Warren joined him at the window and&nbsp;peeked outside. A uniformed driver was&nbsp;unloading a small red satchel from the&nbsp;trunk of the car, but the passenger remained&nbsp;seated inside, a dark shape silhouetted&nbsp;against the backseat window.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s probably a guest,&#x201d; Warren said.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;But what&#x2019;s a <i>guest</i> doing <i>here</i>?&#x201d; Rupert&nbsp;exclaimed. &#x201c;No one comes to this hotel!&nbsp;Not in years! Just look at this place!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Indeed, as with the rest of the hotel, time&nbsp;had taken its toll on the lobby. Sunshine&nbsp;seemed unable to penetrate the room; the&nbsp;only source of light was a tarnished chandelier&nbsp;that clung to the ceiling like an insect.&nbsp;It flickered and buzzed as if it might sputter&nbsp;out at any moment. Underneath sat a faded&nbsp;red velvet couch, its surface encrusted with&nbsp;a thick layer of dust&#x2013;except for a large&nbsp;round area in the shape of Rupert&#x2019;s torso&nbsp;(he often napped there).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not so bad,&#x201d; Warren said cheerfully.&nbsp;&#x201c;I can dust the lobby this afternoon. Everything&nbsp;will look as good as new!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rupert stared helplessly at the wall of&nbsp;keys hanging behind the reception desk.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Which bedroom is best? I&#x2019;ve never been&nbsp;inside them!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Any of the rooms will be fine,&#x201d; Warren&nbsp;said. &#x201c;I clean and vacuum them every week,&nbsp;just to be safe. I always knew this day would&nbsp;come!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a<i> whoosh</i>, the lobby doors swung&nbsp;open and a tall thin figure strode inside. The&nbsp;visitor was dressed all in black, except for&nbsp;white bandages wrapped around a strangely&nbsp;narrow head. Even more surprising, the&nbsp;guest had no luggage of any kind&#x2013;only the&nbsp;small red satchel. Warren could hear delicate&nbsp;glass objects clinking inside.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rupert gaped at the strange figure.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Warren gave a slight bow. &#x201c;W-w-welcome&nbsp;to the Warren Hotel, sir!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The greeting was met with silence.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We&#x2019;re delighted to have you. My name&nbsp;is Warren. What&#x2019;s yours?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The guest did not reply.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Where are you visiting from?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Still more silence.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Have you come far?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Somewhere in the distance, a cricket&nbsp;chirped.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The visitor reached into the folds of&nbsp;a long black topcoat and produced a card&nbsp;with a sharp <i>fwip</i>! Warren tried to accept&nbsp;the offering, but the guest held it just out&nbsp;of reach. Warren could see it was engraved&nbsp;with the image of a four-poster bed.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You&#x2019;d like a room with a bed!&#x201d; Warren&nbsp;exclaimed. &#x201c;Of course! We&#x2019;ll get you set up&nbsp;right away!&#x201d; He looked meaningfully to&nbsp;Uncle Rupert, who continued to stare at&nbsp;the newcomer. &#x201c;All I need is a room key . . .&nbsp;Uncle Rupert?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rupert finally snapped out of his trance.&nbsp;&#x201c;Yes, yes, of course! Right away!&#x201d; He turned&nbsp;to the rack of keys, still overwhelmed by the&nbsp;selection, while Warren attempted to take&nbsp;the stranger&#x2019;s luggage. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be happy to carry&nbsp;your bag to your room. The elevator doesn&#x2019;t&nbsp;work, I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The guest yanked the satchel back as&nbsp;though Warren were diseased.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Warren said, shrinking away.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Here we go!&#x201d; Rupert chimed in, holding&nbsp;up a mottled brass key on a tattered cord.&nbsp;&#x201c;The key to your suite. It has a lovely view!&nbsp;And the room number is printed directly on&nbsp;the surface, in case you get lost in our beautiful&nbsp;corridors!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Warren eyed his uncle skeptically. It&nbsp;was a stretch to call any of the corridors in&nbsp;the hotel &#x201c;beautiful,&#x201d; or any of the rooms&nbsp;a &#x201c;suite,&#x201d; and certainly none of them had&nbsp;what could be considered a &#x201c;lovely view.&#x201d;&nbsp;But he held his tongue as the new guest&nbsp;reached out a bandaged hand and snatched&nbsp;away the key.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Warren followed the stranger up the&nbsp;creaking stairway. If he couldn&#x2019;t carry the&nbsp;bag, he would at least show his new guest to&nbsp;the room. But the visitor whirled around&nbsp;and&#x2013;<i>fwip!</i>&#x2013;produced another card, this&nbsp;one bearing a large red &#x201c;X.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Warren took that to mean &#x201c;Leave me&nbsp;alone,&#x201d; so he gave an awkward bow and&nbsp;retreated to the lobby.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I wonder if he&#x2019;ll expect breakfast,&#x201d;&nbsp;Warren said.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Odd sort of fellow,&#x201d; Rupert muttered.&nbsp;&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t even give us a name.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<i> &nbsp;Paleface</i>, Warren decided as he imagined&nbsp;what might be hidden beneath all those&nbsp;bandages. Wounds? Scars? A third eye? An&nbsp;upside-down nose? Whatever it was, it had&nbsp;to be something pretty horrible. Why else&nbsp;would a person have a face wrapped in gauze?&nbsp;The sound of boot heels clicking upon tile&nbsp;broke Warren&#x2019;s reverie. He turned to see&nbsp;his aunt Annaconda striding into the lobby.&nbsp;Where Uncle Rupert was short and chubby,&nbsp;his new wife was exactly the opposite: tall,&nbsp;elegant, and slender. Her long black hair&nbsp;was pulled tightly into a bun that resembled&nbsp;a viper coiled atop her head.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Am I hearing things?&#x201d; she inquired. &#x201c;Or&nbsp;was there an automobile in the driveway?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;My beautiful queen! My love!&#x201d; Rupert&nbsp;exclaimed, his cheeks glowing with adoration.&nbsp;&#x201c;You are not mistaken. We do indeed&nbsp;have a new guest! A wonderful fellow! He&nbsp;arrived just moments ago.&#x201d;<br>...</p><h2>Christ, the Sum of All Spiritual Things</h2><p>&#34;To sum up all things in Christ&#34; is the mystery of God&#39;s will. This needs to be first realized in the church as well as in each individual member before it can be fulfilled in the universe. How very urgent it is for believers to know the reality of Christ as being our all and in all. For God has not given us many things; He gives us only Christ. Things are dead, but Christ is living. Christ must be all things to us. In this small volume, brother Watchman Nee illustrates this basic principle of &#34;not things but Christ&#34; from various angles with many practical helps. His heart burden is for Christ to become real to us. Let things pass away, let life fill us. May Christ be all and in all.</p><p></p><h2>Refined by Fire: A Family&#39;s Triumph of Love and Faith</h2><p><b>2005 Gold Medallion Award finalist!</b> <br>When hijacked American Flight 77 slammed into the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, LTC (RET) Brian Birdwell was only 15 to 20 yards away. He stepped out into the corridor and was instantly engulfed in flames&#x2015;burns consumed 60 percent of his body, with almost 40 percent of them third-degree. Thirty-plus operations and countless physical therapy sessions later, his recovery has truly been remarkable, and spiritually he and his family are stronger than ever before. Brian and his wife, Mel, tell their captivating story of God's grace and sovereignty.</p><p><b>Lt. Col. Brian Birdwell</b> is a survivor of the terrorist attack on the Pentagon on September 11, 2001. After American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, just yards away from his second floor office, Brian was thrown to the ground and engulfed in flames. Of the burns that consumed 60 percent of his body, nearly half were third-degree burns. After having undergone more than 30 operations and months of multiple skin grafts, burn treatments and therapy sessions, Birdwell has made a remarkable recovery. Despite some physical limitations, he testifies not only to his physical healing, but also to his spiritual healing--the ultimate miracle of grace.<p>Birdwell is married to Melva Collins of Davis, Oklahoma. They have a 14-year-old son, Matthew, and live in Manassas, Virginia.</p>Using vivid first-person narration, the Birdwells describe how Brian suffered second- and third-degree burns over 60% of his body when terrorists crashed a jet into the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, and how the family's Christian faith brought it through Brian's recovery. Birdwell spent three months in the hospital, enduring more than 30 surgeries, daily debridement (removal of unhealthy tissue) and physical therapy. The account alternates between the perspectives of husband and wife, and also incorporates the experiences of their son, Matt. The technique works well throughout; it is most gripping when Brian faces death alone in a flaming hallway and when Mel scrambles through gridlocked traffic to get to the hospital. Details set this book apart. The Birdwells relate Brian's horrific injuries and treatments in a way that might turn some stomachs (skin coming off with his wedding ring, a staph infection that covered his body with green pus). They also expose their own shortcomings: Mel feels guilty about leaving her son and berates some hospital staffers, while Brian expresses anger toward the terrorists. Such confessions lend credence to the Birdwells' belief that only a sovereign God could bring them through their ordeal. This memoir's striking descriptions of the Birdwells' pain, failures and faith against the backdrop of 9-11 will fascinate many readers. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He had forgotten<br>why he was doing all this, the reason that he had picked up a lightsaber<br>in the first place and the reason that he had given himself over to the<br>Sith, the reason that he had taken sole control of the Galactic Alliance.<br><br>To <i>serve.<br></i><br>Caedus had forgotten because he was weak. After Allana had betrayed<br>him by sneaking off the <i>Anakin Solo </i>with his parents, his pain<br>had become a distraction. He had been unable to think, to plan, to<br>command, to read the future . . . to <i>lead. </i>So he had shut away his feelings<br>for Allana, had convinced himself that he was not really doing this<br>for her and the trillions of younglings like her, that he was doing<br>this for destiny&#x2013;for <i>his </i>destiny.<br><br>It had all been a lie. Even after what Allana had done, Caedus still<br>loved her. He was her father, and he would always love her, no matter<br>how much she hurt him. He had been wrong to try to escape that.<br>Caedus needed to hold on to that love <i>whatever </i>it cost him, to cling to<br>that love even as it tore his heart apart.<br><br>Because that was how Sith stayed strong. They <i>needed </i>pain to keep<br>the Balance, to remind them they were still human. And they needed<br>it so they would not forget the pain they were inflicting on others. To<br>make the galaxy safer, <i>everyone </i>had to suffer&#x2013;even Sith Lords.<br><br>And so there would be no angry outbursts when he confronted<br>the Moffs over their unauthorized adventures, no demonstration killings,<br>no Force chokings or threats to have his fleets attack theirs, no<br>intimidation of any sort. There would be no consequences at all, for<br>how were they to know of the worrisome things he had been seeing in<br>his Force visions lately&#x2013;the Mandalorian maniacs and the burning asteroids,<br>his uncle&#x2019;s inescapable gaze&#x2013;if he failed to <i>tell </i>them? Whether<br>blunder or master stroke, the taking of the Roche system was as much<br>his doing as the Moffs&#x2019;, Caedus saw now, and he was beyond punishing<br>others for his mistakes. Starting today, Darth Caedus was going to<br>rule not through anger or fear or even bribery, but as every true Sith<br>Lord should, through patience and love and . . . pain.<br><br>Caedus finally crested the winding pedramp he had been ascending<br>and found himself looking down a long tubular tunnel coated in<br>the gray-yellow foamcrete the Verpine reserved for their royal warrens.<br>At the far end&#x2013;guarding one of the shiny new <i>beskar</i>-alloy blast<br>hatches that had done absolutely nothing to stop the Remnant&#x2019;s<br>aerosol attack&#x2013;stood a squad of white-armored stormtroopers. Their<br>gray-striped shoulder plates identified them as members of the Imperial<br>Elite Guard, and the two tripod-mounted E-Webs set along the<br>walls suggested they were serious about preventing unauthorized access<br>to the chamber beyond.<br><br>The stormtroopers were still turning in his direction, no doubt<br>trying to decide whether the single black-clad figure striding toward<br>them was anything to be alarmed about, when Caedus raised a gloved<br>hand and made a grasping motion. The squad leader raised his own<br>hand as though returning the greeting&#x2013;then was knocked off his feet<br>as both E-Web supply cables tore free of the power generators and<br>came flying down the corridor with weapon and tripod bouncing<br>along behind them.<br><br>The remainder of the squad swiftly moved to firing positions,<br>dropping to a knee in the middle of the corridor or pressing themselves<br>against the tunnel wall, and brought their blaster rifles to their<br>shoulders. Caedus sent a surge of Force energy sizzling down the corridor,<br>reducing the electronic opticals inside their helmets to a blizzard<br>of static. They opened fire anyway, but most of the bolts went wide,<br>and those that did not Caedus deflected with the occasional flick of a<br>hand.<br><br>He was still ten paces away when the squad leader pulled his helmet<br>off and, bringing his weapon to bear, began yelling for the others<br>to do the same. Caedus raised his arm, catching the leader&#x2019;s bolts on<br>his palm and deflecting them harmlessly down the tunnel. As the second<br>and third man prepared to open fire, he flicked a finger toward the<br>leader&#x2019;s blaster and sent it spinning into them. It slammed the second<br>man into the wall and knocked the third&#x2019;s weapon from his hands.<br><br>Caedus summoned the leader forward with two fingers, using the<br>Force to bring the astonished soldier flying into his grasp.<br><br>&#x201c;I have no intention of harming anyone beyond that door,&#x201d; Caedus<br>said, making his voice deep and commanding. &#x201c;But I have no time<br>to waste, so I won&#x2019;t hesitate to kill <i>you </i>or your men. I trust that won&#x2019;t<br>be necessary?&#x201d;<br><b><br></b>The sergeant&#x2019;s eyes bulged as though his throat were actually<br>being squeezed shut&#x2013;which it was not&#x2013;and his face paled to the<br>color of his armor.<br><br>&#x201c;N-n-no, sir. N-not at all.&#x201d; The sergeant motioned for his men to<br>lower their weapons. &#x201c;S-s-sorry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No apologies necessary, Sergeant,&#x201d; Caedus said. &#x201c;Obviously, you<br>haven&#x2019;t been informed of the new chain of command.&#x201d;<br><br>Caedus set the sergeant&#x2019;s boots back on the tunnel floor, then<br>turned to look at each of the others in the squad. He made it appear<br>that he was requiring each man to look into his yellow eyes, but actually<br>he was Force-probing their emotions, looking for any hint of<br>anger or resentment that suggested there might be a hero in the<br>group. He was down to the last two when he sensed a fist of resolve<br>tightening inside one.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do it, trooper,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;There aren&#x2019;t enough good soldiers<br>in the Alliance as it is.&#x201d;<br><br>The fist of resolve immediately began to loosen, but the trooper<br>wasn&#x2019;t too surprised to say, &#x201c;With all due respect, <i>Colonel, </i>we&#x2019;re <i>not<br></i>Alliance soldiers.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not yet.&#x201d; Caedus gave him a warm smile and turned toward the<br>blast hatch, presenting his back to the entire squad. &#x201c;My escorts will<br>be along shortly. Don&#x2019;t start a firefight with them.&#x201d;<br><br>When he felt the squad leader motion the hero and everyone else<br>to lower their weapons, Caedus nodded his approval without turning<br>around. Then he circled his hand in front of the blast door, using the<br>Force to send a surge of energy through its internal circuitry until a series<br>of sharp clicks announced that the locking mechanisms had retracted.<br>A moment later, a loud hiss sounded from inside the heavy<br>hatch, and it slid aside into the wall.<br><br>Caedus stepped through without hesitation and found himself<br>looking down on a sunken conference pit where a couple dozen<br>Imperial Moffs&#x2013;most of the survivors of the slaughter aboard the<br><i>Bloodfin</i>&#x2013;were rising to their feet, some reaching for their sidearms<br>and others looking for a place to take cover. Across from them, a small<br>swarm of insectoid administrators from other Verpine hives squatted<br>on their haunches, their shiny heads cocked in confusion and their<br>mandibles spread wide in an instinctive threat display.<br><b><br></b>&#x201c;No, please.&#x201d; Caedus extended his arms toward the Moffs and<br>motioned for them to return to their seats&#x2013;using the Force to compel<br>obedience. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get up on my account.&#x201d;<br><br>The Moffs dropped almost as one. Most landed in the chairs they<br>had been occupying, but a couple missed and landed on the floor. Several<br>of the aides standing behind the Moffs&#x2019; chairs were pointing holdout<br>blasters in his direction, looking to their superiors for some hint as<br>to whether they should open fire or stand down. Caedus swept his arm<br>up and sent them all flying out of the conference pit onto the surrounding<br>service floor.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid this will be a confidential conversation,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Leave us.&#x201d;<br><br>When the aides did not instantly obey, he gestured at one of those<br>who had been pointing a blaster at him and sent the man tumbling out<br>the hatch.<br><i><br>&#x201c;Now.&#x201d;<br></i><br>The remainder of the aides scrambled for the door, many without<br>bothering to stand. Caedus watched them go, his attention divided<br>between them and the Moffs, ready to pin motionless anyone who<br>even thought about raising a weapon. Once the aides were gone, a<br>simple glance was all it took to send the Verpine administrators scuttling<br>after them, leaving him and the Moffs alone with a single huge<br>Verpine with age-silvered eyebulbs and a translucent patch on her thorax<br>where the carahide was growing thin. She showed no inclination to<br>rise from her position at the far end of the conference table, where she<br>lay stretched along a heavily cushioned throne pedestal.<br><br>&#x201c;Jacen Solo, where will the hives ever gather the wealth to settle<br>our account?&#x201d; The Verpine spoke in an ancient, thrumming voice that<br>seemed to resonate from the very bottom of her long abdomen. As the<br>High Coordinator of the Roche system&#x2019;s capital asteroid, she was effectively<br>the hive mother and chief executive officer of her entire civilization,<br>outranking even the Verpine&#x2019;s public face, Speaker Sass Sikili.<br>&#x201c;First, you rescue us from the Ancient Ones, and now you come with<br>your fleet to send away the whiteshells. Welcome.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Your Maternellence. But the name now is Caedus.<br><i>Darth </i>Caedus.&#x201d;<br><br>The hive mother inclined her head. &#x201c;We have heard you went<br>through a metamorphosis. It is hard to believe you were just a larva<br>when you saved us before.&#x201d; She unfolded an age-curved arm and gestured<br>at the Moffs. &#x201c;The hives will be happily rid of these wasps. Proceed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wish it were that simple,&#x201d; Caedus said. He turned his attention<br>to the Moffs, who were studying him with expressions ranging from<br>impatience to annoyance, depending on whether they were brave, astute,<br>or just plain foolhardy. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re misinterpreting our presence.<br>My fleet and I aren&#x2019;t here to <i>free </i>the Roche system&#x2013;we&#x2019;re here to<br><i>hold </i>it.&#x201d;<br><br>It was difficult to tell who was more outraged, the mandibleclacking<br>hive mother or the grumbling Moffs. Caedus raised his hand<br>and&#x2013;when that failed to produce quiet&#x2013;used the Force to muffle the<br>clamor.<br><br>As soon as he could be sure of making himself heard again, he said,<br>&#x201c;This will be best for everyone. The conquest of the Roche system has<br>given it a significance far beyond the value of its munitions factories.&#x201d;<br><br>The hive mother raised her thorax off her couch and demanded,<br>&#x201c;What significance? The hives are neutral! We have nothing to do with<br>your war.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have been selling munitions to all sides&#x2013;and profiting handsomely,&#x201d;<br>interrupted a combat-trim Moff with close-cropped gray<br>hair. &#x201c;That makes you a legitimate target.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Moff Lecersen makes a good point,&#x201d; Caedus said. &#x201c;And I <i>did<br></i>warn you that the Mandalorians lacked the strength to protect you.&#x201d;<br>Before the hive mother could argue, he turned to Lecersen. &#x201c;But the<br>Moff Council should have consulted with me before acting. There<br>have been indications in the Force all along that this invasion would be<br>a mistake.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because you want the Roche munitions factories for yourself ?&#x201d;<br>scoffed a youthful Moff.<br><br>Caedus recognized him from intelligence holos as Voryam Bhao.<br>With his honey-colored complexion, curly black hair, and a sneering<br>upper lip just begging to be ripped off his face, he looked even<br>younger than the twenty-three standard years listed in his file.<br><br>&#x201c;Spare us your dark prophecies, <i>Colonel </i>Solo,&#x201d; Bhao continued<br>boldly. &#x201c;Everyone at this table sees what you&#x2019;re trying to do.&#x201d;<br><br>The bile began to rise in Caedus&#x2019;s throat, but he reminded himself<br>of his resolution and resisted the urge to snap the young Moff&#x2019;s<br>neck&#x2013;as he had Lieutenant Tebut&#x2019;s not so long ago.<br><br>Instead, he said in a calm, durasteel voice, &#x201c;You really should listen<br>more carefully, Moff Bhao.&#x201d; He made a dipping motion with his<br>index finger, and Bhao&#x2019;s head sank toward the table as though he were<br>bowing. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Caedus now. <i>Darth </i>Caedus.&#x201d;<br><br>If Bhao&#x2019;s older peers were amused, they did not show it&#x2013;not even<br>in the Force. They simply glared at Caedus, and another of the<br>Moffs&#x2013;this one a round-faced man with a roll of red neck-flab hanging<br>over the collar of his buttoned tunic&#x2013;shook his head in open disapproval.<br><br>&#x201c;We are all aware that you are very powerful in the Force, Darth<br>Caedus,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But you seem to be forgetting that <i>we </i>are quite<br>powerful in our own right. If not for us, that catastrophe at Fondor<br>would have been the end of you <i>and </i>the Galactic Alliance.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nor do we need to <i>consult </i>with you about anything,&#x201d; Moff<br>Lecersen added. &#x201c;The last I checked, the Empire was an <i>ally </i>of the<br>Galactic Alliance, not its territory. We don&#x2019;t need your permission to<br>conduct our operations . . . and we surely don&#x2019;t need your fleets to<br>hold what we take.&#x201d;<br><br>Caedus brought his anger under control by reminding himself that<br>he <i>deserved </i>such a rebuke. He had not failed at Fondor because of<br>Niathal&#x2019;s treachery, or his admirals&#x2019; lack of boldness, or even because<br>of Daala&#x2019;s surprise attack. He had failed because of his own blindness,<br>because he had allowed his anguish over Allana&#x2019;s betrayal to make him<br>arrogant and selfish and vindictive.<br><br>And then, once his thinking had cleared, he began to see how the<br>situation must look to someone who did not have the Force. To someone<br>who could not look into the future and see Luke hunting him<br>down, or see Mandalorian maniacs bursting from walls and asteroids<br>burning as bright as stars, Caedus&#x2019;s assertion might be hard to believe.<br>Without such foresight, it might be easy to convince oneself that this<br>lonely cluster of rocks could not be as important as all that&#x2013;that the<br>balance of an interstellar war could never hinge on what was about to<br>happen <i>here.<br></i><br>After a moment&#x2019;s silence, Caedus said, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t believe me.&#x201d;<br><br>His tone was more disappointed than angry. &#x201c;You think this is about<br>spoils.&#x201d;<br><br>Lecersen exchanged suspicious glances with several of the other<br>Moffs, then asked, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t really expect us to believe you came out<br>here to <i>protect </i>us, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>Caedus had to stifle a laugh. While he hadn&#x2019;t been thinking of it<br>in those terms, he realized that was <i>exactly </i>what he was doing here&#x2013;<br>protecting the Moffs and their crucial fleets.<br><br>&#x201c;I suppose that <i>does </i>sound absurd.&#x201d; Realizing that only events<br>themselves would convince the Moffs of his sincerity, Caedus turned<br>and started toward the exit. &#x201c;The truth so often d...</p><h2>Down the River</h2><p><i>Down the River </i>is a collection of essays both timeless and timely. It is an exploration of the abiding beauty of some of the last great stretches of American wilderness on voyages down rivers where the body and mind float free, and the grandeur of nature gives rise to meditations on everything from the life of Henry David Thoreau to the militarization of the open range. At the same time, it is an impassioned condemnation of what is being done to our natural heritage in the name of progress, profit, and security. Filled with fiery dawns, wild and shining rivers, and radiant sandstone canyons, it is charged as well with heartfelt, rampageous rage at human greed, blindness, and folly.

Margaret McNamara employs the letter-writing style of the period to tell the story of Eliza Hamilton, who was born into a family of considerable wealth, power, and influence in Albany, New York, in 1757. Eliza was expected to marry into a similarly powerful family . . . until she met and fell in love with the charismatic Hamilton. She stood by him throughout his tumultuous life, and after his death, she single-handedly collected his papers and preserved them for historians and musical-theater writers of the future. Eliza outlived Hamilton by fifty years; during that time she founded the first orphanage in New York State, raised funds for the Washington Monument, and kept the flame of her husband's memory and achievements alive.

The result was a rare musical treasury containing complete music and lyrics for over 130 songs, arranged by geographical region. <br>Among them are: Roll, Jordan, Roll; Jehovah, Hallelujah; I hear from Heaven to-day; Michael, row the boat ashore; Turn sinner, turn O; Nobody knows the trouble I've had; No Man can hinder me; Heave away; Charleston Gals; I'm gwine to Alabamy; I want to die like-a Lazarus die; Belle Layotte; On to Glory Jacob's Ladder; My Father, how long?; Musieu Bainjo; Lean on the Lord's side; God got plenty o' room.<br>The book presents the melody lone and all the known verses to each song. The editors also include directions for singing, along with a commentary on each song's history, its possible variations, what some of its key references mean and other pertinent details. A new preface to the Dover edition by Harold Courlander appraises the book's importance in American musical and cultural history.</p><p></p></p><p>Originally published in 1867, this book is a collection of songs of African-American slaves. A few of the songs were written after the emancipation, but all were inspired by slavery. The wild, sad strains tell, as the sufferers themselves could, of crushed hopes, keen sorrow, and a dull, daily misery, which covered them as hopelessly as the fog from the rice swamps. On the other hand, the words breathe a trusting faith in the life after, to which their eyes seem constantly turned.William Francis Allen, the chief editor and author of the introduction to Slave Songs of the United States, was born in Massachusetts in 1830, studied at Harvard and in Europe, worked for the Freedmen's Aid Commission on St. Helena Island, South Carolina, during the Civil War, and after the war became chair of ancient languages at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.<br><br>Like his cousin William Francis Allen, Charles Pickard Ware took part in wartime educational initiatives in the Sea Islands of South Carolina; more of the transcriptions in the volume are Ware's than any other editor's.<br><br>Lucy McKim Garrison grew up among reformers in mid-nineteenth century Philadelphia, worked on the New York Nation with her husband Wendell Garrison, son of William Lloyd Garrison, and initiated the project of collecting and annotating slave songs in the Sea Islands during the Civil War.</p><h2>The Way Is Made by Walking: A Pilgrimage Along the Camino de Santiago</h2><p><ul><li>The Word Guild 2008 Canadian Christian Writing Awards finalist</li></ul> Pilgrimage is a spiritual discipline not many consider. Aren't the destinations far? Don't they involve a lot of time and walking? Just a few years ago, Arthur Paul Boers wasn't thinking about pilgrimage either. But he began to sense a deep call from God to walk the five-hundred-mile pilgrimage route known as Camino de Santiago, ending in Santiago de Compostela, Spain, at a cathedral that is said to hold the relics of the apostle James. In these pages he opens to us his incredible story of renewed spirituality springing from an old, old path walked by millions before him. It's a story of learning to pray in new ways, embracing simplicity, forming community, living each day centered and focused, depending on God to provide. Joined by hundreds of others from all over the world, Boers points the way to deeper intimacy with God--a way made by walking in faith.</p><p><strong>Arthur Paul Boers</strong> is associate professor of pastoral theology at Associated Mennonite Biblical Seminary in Elkhart, Indiana.

In addition to his widely acclaimed paraphrase of the Bible, <em>The Message</em> (NavPress), he has written many other books."Boer's account is a testimony to the importance of physicality to the spiritual life. <em>The Way Is Made by Walking</em> is an invitation to embody pilgrimage." (The Christian Century, January 27, 2009)<br><br>"This book is neither a travelogue nor a guide to walking the Camino, but rather a spiritual reflection, which may be enriching even for those who will never walk the Camino." (Jeremy M. Bergen, The Mennonite Quarterly Review, January 2009)<br><br>"After a lifetime of theology and lectures Boers applies his mind to going deeper and taking us along with him. He challenges us who are part of the Church to engage the spiritual longings in our culture by naming the shallowness of the life many of us live, and the need to model more grace-filled lives." (Warwick Cooper, Christian Week, November 15, 2008)<br><br>"On his 31-day trek along the 500-mile pilgrimage route of Camino de Santiago in Spain, Arthur Paul Boers became more aware of God at work in every detail, more sensitive to the spiritual needs of fellow pilgrims, and more convinced of the need to simplify his life." (Sonya VanderVeen Feddema, The Banner (thebanner.org), June 2008)<br><br>"His faith comes through clearly, and I think that active Christians would particularly enjoy this search for spiritual renewal." (Ralph Alcorn, Backpack45 (backpack45.com), February 2008)<br><br>"The reader will find here a rich mix of hermeneutics, social commentary and practical advice. . . . Boers vindicates pilgrimage as spiritual exercise. . . . I am grateful for this . . . book that reaffirms my disposition to embark soon on the <em>camino</em> de Santiago." (Segundo Pantoja, Catholic Books Review, January 2008)<br><br>"I highly recommend this book for those who have thought of doing a similar pilgrimage and those who have never thought of doing a pilgrimage. This is both a wonderful account of the physical hardships of a 500-mile journey and the even tougher, more life-changing aspects of the spiritual journey resulting from such a trip."

(CBA Retailers + Resources, September 2007)<br><br>"Everything seems up for grabs, and nothing seems fulfilling any longer. But in this unassuming and engaging chronicle Arthur Boers shows that gravity and grace can be recovered step by step. And for those of us who can't go on a pilgrimage, there are wonderful lessons to be learned from one who did." (Albert Borgmann, author of Real American Ethics)<br><br>"Pack your fantasy knapsack; walk with Arthur Boers on the adventure of a lifetime, the five-hundred-mile pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in Spain. What a lively, sensitive, down-to-earth and deeply spiritual guide Boers is! His tales as a pilgrim will so captivate your imagination that you could find yourself in real time, walking stick in hand, making your way along that sacred path made holy by the faith of countless pilgrims."

Information technology can and should deliver business value. But the Agile literature has paid scant attention to what business value means&#x2015;and how to know whether or not you are delivering it. This problem becomes ever more critical as you push value delivery toward autonomous teams and away from requirements &#x201c;tossed over the wall&#x201d; by business stakeholders. An empowered team needs to understand its goal!<br>Playful and thought-provoking, The Art of Business Value explores what business value means, why it matters, and how it should affect your software development and delivery practices. More than any other IT delivery approach, DevOps (and Agile thinking in general) makes business value a central concern. This book examines the role of business value in software and makes a compelling case for why a clear understanding of business value will change the way you deliver software.<br>This book will make you think deeply about not only what it means to deliver value but also the relationship of the IT organization to the rest of the enterprise. It will give you the language to discuss value with the business, methods to cut through bureaucracy, and strategies for incorporating Agile teams and culture into the enterprise. Most of all, this book will startle you into new ways of thinking about the cutting-edge of Agile practice and where it may lead.</p><p>Mark Schwartz is an iconoclastic CIO and a playful crafter of ideas, an inveterate purveyor of lucubratory prose.

In this compelling text, authors Mark A. Burkholder, Lyman L. Johnson, and Monica A. Rankin tell the story of more than 500 years of Latin American history through the themes of exploitation, inequality, and resistance.<br><br>Some examples of exploitation and inequality include slavery and other labor systems, sexual and gender exploitation, an inequitable economic relationship with foreign countries, repressive political systems through dictatorship and military regimes, and an unequal diplomatic relationship with the United States and other powerful nations. Despite deeply entrenched systems of injustice, Latin Americans remain notable for their resilience. Active and passive resistance to oppression and discrimination still persist in the twenty-first century, with native revolts and slave flights, unionization, the emergence of the Latin American women's movement, black-market economies, the emergence of populism, and various forms of revolt and revolution. <em>Exploitation, Inequality, and Resistance: A History of Latin America since Columbus</em> emphasizes these themes and analyzes the ways in which earlier events continue to resonate today.<br></p><p><br><strong>Mark Burkholder</strong> is Curators' Professor of History at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.

It is early in the year. Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus sits on a lofty platform beside the Ocean. As waves break on the shore and spray hangs in the air, he gazes out to sea. Many Roman ships over the years have been lost to its depths. Strange monsters are rumoured to lurk in its grey waters, while beyond the horizon there lies an island teeming with savage and mustachioed head-hunters: Britain. Perils such as these, lurking as they do on the very margins of civilisation, are fit to challenge even the boldest and most iron-willed hero.<br> &nbsp;<br> The story of the Roman people, though, has always had about it an aura of the epic. They have emerged from dim and provincial obscurity to the command of the world: a feat like no other in history. Repeatedly put to trial, repeatedly surviving it triumphant, Rome has been well steeled for global rule. Now, seven hundred and ninety-two years after her founding, the man who ranks as her emperor wields power worthy of a god. Lined up alongside him on the northern beach are rank upon rank of the most formidable fighting force on the planet: armour-clad legionaries, catapults, battlefield artillery. The Emperor Gaius scans their length. He gives a command. At once, there is a blaring of trumpets. The signal for battle. Then silence. The Emperor raises his voice.&nbsp;'Soldiers!'&nbsp;he cries.&nbsp;'I command you to pick up shells. Fill your helmets with the spoils of the Ocean.'&nbsp;And the legionaries, obedient to their emperor's order, do so.<br> &nbsp;<br> Such, at any rate, is the story. But is it true? Did the soldiers really pick up shells? And if they did &#x2013; why? The episode is one of the most&nbsp;notorious in the life of a man whose entire career remains to this day a thing of infamy. Caligula, the name by which the Emperor Gaius is better known, is one of the few people from ancient history to be as familiar to pornographers as to classicists. The scandalous details of his reign have always provoked prurient fascination.&nbsp;'But enough of the emperor; now to the monster.'&nbsp;So wrote Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus, a scholar and archivist in the imperial palace who doubled in his spare time as a biographer of the Caesars, and whose life of Caligula is the oldest extant one that we possess. Written almost a century after the Emperor's death, it catalogues a quite sensational array of depravities and crimes. He slept with his sisters! He dressed up as the goddess Venus! He planned to award his horse the highest magistracy in Rome! Set against the background of such stunts, Caligula's behaviour on the Channel coast comes to seem a good deal less surprising. Suetonius certainly had no problem in explaining his behaviour.&nbsp;'He was ill in both body and mind.'<br> &nbsp;<br> But if Caligula was sick, then so too was Rome. The powers of life and death wielded by an emperor would have been abhorrent to an earlier generation. Almost a century before Caligula massed his legions on the shores of the Ocean and gazed out to Britain, his great-great-great-great-uncle had done the same &#x2013; and then actually crossed the Channel. The exploits of Gaius Julius Caesar had been as spectacular as any in his city's history: not only two invasions of Britain but the permanent annexation of Gaul, as the Romans called what today is France. He had achieved his feats, though, as a citizen of a republic &#x2013; one in which it was taken for granted by most that death was the only conceivable alternative to liberty. When Julius Caesar, trampling down this presumption, had laid claim to a primacy over his fellow citizens, it had resulted first in civil war, and then, after he had crushed his domestic foes as he had previously crushed the Gauls, in his assassination. Only after two more murderous bouts of slaughtering one another had the Roman people finally been inured to their servitude. Submission to the rule of a single man had redeemed their city and its empire from self-destruction &#x2013; but the cure itself had been a kind of sickness.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Augustus</i>, their new master had called himself,&nbsp;'The Divinely Favoured One'. The great-nephew of Julius Caesar, he had waded through blood to secure the command of Rome and her empire &#x2013; and then, his rivals once dispatched, had coolly posed as a prince of peace. As cunning as he was ruthless, as patient as he was decisive, Augustus had managed to maintain his supremacy for decades, and then to die in his bed. Key to this achievement had been his ability to rule with rather than against the grain of Roman tradition: for by pretending that he was not an autocrat, he had licensed his fellow citizens to pretend that they were still free. A veil of shimmering and seductive subtlety had been draped over the brute contours of his dominance. Time, though, had seen this veil become increasingly threadbare. On Augustus's death in&nbsp;AD&nbsp;14, the powers that he had accumulated over the course of his long and mendacious career stood revealed, not as temporary expediencies, but rather as a package to be handed down to an heir. His choice of successor had been a man raised since childhood in his own household, an aristocrat by the name of Tiberius. The many qualities of the new Caesar, which ranged from exemplary aristocratic pedigree to a track record as Rome's finest general, had counted for less than his status as Augustus's adopted son &#x2013; and everyone had known it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tiberius, a man who all his life had been wedded to the virtues of the vanished Republic, had made an unhappy monarch; but Caligula, who had succeeded him in turn after a reign of twenty-three years, was unembarrassed. That he ruled the Roman world by virtue neither of age nor of experience, but as the great-grandson of Augustus, bothered him not the slightest.&nbsp;'Nature produced him, in my opinion, to demonstrate just how far unlimited vice can go when combined with unlimited power.'&nbsp;Such was the obituary delivered on him by Seneca, a philosopher who had known him well. The judgement, though, was not just on Caligula, but on Seneca's own peers, who had&nbsp;cringed and grovelled before the Emperor while he was still alive, and on the Roman people as a whole. The age was a rotten one: diseased, debased, degraded.<br> &nbsp;<br> Or so many believed. Not everyone agreed. The regime established by Augustus would never have endured had it failed to offer what the Roman people had come so desperately to crave after decades of civil war: peace and order. The vast agglomeration of provinces ruled from Rome, which stretched from the North Sea to the Sahara, and from the Atlantic to the Fertile Crescent, reaped the benefits as well. Three centuries on, when the nativity of the most celebrated man to have been born in Augustus's reign stood in infinitely clearer focus than it had done at the time, a bishop named Eusebius could see in the Emperor's achievements the very guiding hand of God.&nbsp;'It was not just as a consequence of human action,'&nbsp;he declared,&nbsp;'that the greater part of the world should have come under Roman rule at the precise moment Jesus was born. The coincidence that saw our Saviour begin his mission against such a backdrop was undeniably arranged by divine agency. After all &#x2013; had the world still been at war, and not united under a single form of government, then how much more difficult would it have been for the disciples to undertake their travels.'<br> &nbsp;<br> Eusebius could see, with the perspective provided by distance, just how startling was the feat of globalisation brought to fulfilment under Augustus and his successors. Brutal though the methods deployed to uphold it were, the sheer immensity of the regions pacified by Roman arms was unprecedented.&nbsp;'To accept a gift,'&nbsp;went an ancient saying,&nbsp;'is to sell your liberty.'&nbsp;Rome held her conquests in fee; but the peace that she bestowed upon them in exchange was not necessarily to be sniffed at. Whether in the suburbs of the capital itself, booming under the Caesars to become the largest city the world had ever seen, or across the span of the Mediterranean, united now for the first time under a single power, or in the furthermost corners of an empire whose global reach was without precedent, the&nbsp;<i>pax&nbsp;Romana</i>&nbsp;brought benefits to millions. Provincials might well be grateful.&nbsp;'He cleared the sea of pirates, and filled it with merchant shipping.'&nbsp;So a Jew from the great Egyptian metropolis of Alexandria, writing in praise of Augustus, enthused.&nbsp;'He gave freedom to every city, brought order where there had been chaos, and civilised savage peoples.'Similar hymns of praise could be &#x2013; and were &#x2013; addressed to&nbsp;Tiberius and Caligula. The depravities for which both men would end up notorious rarely had much impact on the world at large. It mattered little in the provinces who ruled as emperor &#x2013; just so long as the centre held.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nevertheless, even in the furthest reaches of the Empire, Caesar was a constant presence. How could he not be?&nbsp;'In the whole wide world, there is not a single thing that escapes him.'&nbsp;An exaggeration, of course &#x2013; and yet due reflection of the mingled fear and awe that an emperor could hardly help but inspire in his subjects. He alone had command of Rome's monopoly of violence: the legions and the whole menacing apparatus of provincial government, which existed to ensure that taxes were paid, rebels slaughtered, and malefactors thrown to beasts or nailed up on crosses. There was no need for an emperor constantly to be showing his hand for dread of his arbitrary power to be universal across the world. Small wonder, then, that the face of Caesar should have become, for millions of his subjects, the face of Rome. Rare was the town that did not boast some image of him: a statue, a portrait bust, a frieze. Even in the most provincial backwater, to handle money was to be familiar with Caesar's profile. Within Augustus's own lifetime, no living citizen had ever appeared on a Roman coin; but no sooner had he seized control of the world than his face was being minted everywhere, stamped on gold, and silver, and bronze.&nbsp;'Whose likeness and inscription is this?'&nbsp;Even an itinerant street-preacher in the wilds of Galilee, holding up a coin and demanding to know whose face it portrayed, could be confident of the answer:&nbsp;'Caesar's.'&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> No surprise, then, that the character of an emperor, his&nbsp;achievements, his relationships and his foibles, should have been topics of obsessive fascination to his subjects.&nbsp;'Your destiny it is to live as in a theatre where your audience is the entire world.'9&nbsp;Such was the warning attributed by one Roman historian to Maecenas, a particularly trusted confidant of Augustus's. Whether he really said it or not, the sentiment&nbsp;was true to the sheer theatricality of his master's performance. Augustus himself, lying on his deathbed, was reported by Suetonius to have asked his friends whether he had played his part well in the comedy of life; and then, on being assured that he had, to have demanded their applause as he headed for the exit. A good emperor had no choice but to be a good actor &#x2013; as too did everyone else in the drama's cast. Caesar, after all, was never alone on the stage. His potential successors were public figures simply by virtue of their relationship to him. Even the wife, the niece or the granddaughter of an emperor might have her role to play. Get it wrong, and she was liable to pay a terrible price; but get it right, and her face might end up appearing on coins alongside Caesar's own. No household in history had ever before been so squarely in the public eye as that of Augustus. The fashions and hairstyles of its most prominent members, reproduced in exquisite detail by sculptors across the Empire, set trends from Syria to Spain. Their achievements were celebrated with spectacularly showy monuments, their scandals repeated with relish from seaport to seaport. Propaganda and gossip, each feeding off the other, gave to the dynasty of Augustus a celebrity that ranked, for the first time, as continent-spanning.<br> &nbsp;<br> To what extent, though, did all the vaunting claims chiselled into showy marble and all the rumours whispered in marketplaces and bars approximate to what had actually happened in Caesar's palace? To be sure, by the time that Suetonius came to write his biographies of the emperors, there was no lack of material for him to draw upon: everything from official inscriptions to garbled gossip. Shrewder analysts, though, when they sought to make sense of Augustus and&nbsp;his heirs, could recognise at the heart of the dynasty's story a darkness that mocked and defied their efforts. Once, back in the days of the Republic, affairs of state had been debated in public, and the speeches of Rome's leaders transcribed for historians to study; but with the coming to power of Augustus, all that had changed.&nbsp;'For, from then on, things began to be done secretly, and in such a way as not to be made public.'&nbsp;Yes, the old rhythms of the political year, the annual cycle of elections and magistracies that once, back in the days of the Republic, had delivered&nbsp;to ambitious Romans the genuine opportunity to sway their city's fate, still endured &#x2013; but as a largely irrelevant sideshow. The cockpit of power lay elsewhere now. The world had come to be governed, not in assemblies of the great and good, but in private chambers. A woman's whisperings in an emperor's ear, a document discreetly passed to him by a slave: either might have a greater impact than even the most ringing public oration. The implication, for any biographer of the Caesars, was grim but inescapable.&nbsp;'Even when it comes to notable events, we are in the dark.'</p><h2>Batman: Batman and Son (New Edition)</h2><p>Batman receives the shock of his life when he discovers that he has a son, Damian Wayne!

On Prehistoric Man 144 Appendix II. On Authority and Accuracy 145 THE PLAN OF THIS BOOK There are two ways of getting home; and one of them is to stay there. The other is to walk round the whole world till we come back to the same place; and I tried to trace such a journey in a story I once wrote. It is, however, a relief to turn from that topic to another story that I never wrote. Like every book I never wrote, it is by far the best book I have ever written. It is only too probable that I shall never write it, so I will use it symbolically here; for it was a symbol of the same truth. I conceived it as a romance of those vast valleys with sloping sides, like those along which the ancient White Horses of Wessex are scrawled along the flanks of the hills. It concerned some boy whose farm or cottage stood on such a slope, and who went on his travels to find something, such as the effigy and grave of some giant; and when he was far enough from home he looked back and saw that his own farm and kitchen-garden, shining flat on the hill-side like the colours and quarterings of a shield, were but parts of some such gigantic figure, on which he had always lived, but which was too large and too close to be seen. That, I think, is a true picture of the progress of any really independent intelligence today; and that is the point of this book.</p><p></p><h2>How to Read Your Opponent&#39;s Cards: The Bridge Experts&#39; Way to Locate Missing High Cards</h2><p>Each chapter takes a principle, helps the reader understand it, and gives examples, plus a quiz on the subject.

She&#39;s spent two decades studying why, among smart, capable people, some project credibility and others don&#39;t. As a corporate trainer and keynote speaker, Alter has worked with a wide range of organizations from high tech to heavy machinery, including eBay, Facebook, Google, Caterpillar, Fireman&#39;s Fund, Kendall Jackson, Williams-Sonoma, Harvard Medical School, and UC Hastings College of the Law. She is also a popular instructor at Stanford Continuing Studies and UC Berkeley Extension, and has worked professionally as a commercial and voice-over actress.People make up their mind in a split second whether you have credibility or not. Ms. Alter has compiled a series of specific behaviours that can help in such situations, particularly when you re not feeling at your best. Many people believe that credibility, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. In truth, very specific behaviours lead us to an assessment of credibility, she writes. Three pillars combine to project credibility: a strong posture, a strong voice, and strong eye contact. The book offers tips on how to take control in each area, so you aren t undermining yourself in meetings with colleagues or clients, or in high-profile interviews to gain jobs. The posture code boils down to five essentials: Keep your spine tall and strong. Stand with your weight balanced equally on both feet. Keep your head level. Point your nose directly at the listener. And command the space around you. Strong posture will make you seem more dynamic, she says. It helps to practise. You can check your posture when you're in line at the grocery store, or riding an escalator. You can take a field trip around your office, chatting with colleagues and consciously checking to make sure that your head is level, you are balanced, and your nose is pointed directly at the other party. To build credibility through vocal behaviour, speak with optimal volume, articulate clearly, keep the pacing relaxed, and highlight your message with expression. For most people, the greatest opportunity for growth is in making ourselves more audible. In particular, watch that you don't speak too softly or drop volume at the end of phrases or sentences. In general, the more crisply you enunciate your words, the more intelligent and the more attentive to detail you ll sound, the author adds. The more lazily you articulate your words, the less intelligent and less credible others will perceive you. The most influential vocal skill, she suggests, is resonance. You want a memorable sound, like James Earl Jones or Oprah Winfrey. That comes with engaging your diaphragm, seeking a stronger sound from below. Credibility also requires making and holding eye contact. Ms. Alter notes that this is reciprocal, so if when speaking people aren t looking at you, perhaps you aren t looking at them. Maintaining eye contact also pushes back at our tendency to be self-focused, and automatically turns our focus to the other people we're talking to. When giving a presentation, she encourages you to copy a sheepdog, constantly corralling the wandering sheep. Never let any part of the room go too long without some attention from you, she suggests. Maintain eye contact with everyone, regardless of rank or apparent enthusiasm. You ll seem more like a leader, more inclusive, and more in command. The book covers many important areas, including how to control your gestures; the derailers that can subtly erode your credibility, such as Caroline Kennedy s ums and you knows that cut short her bid for a U.S. Senate seat when Hillary Clinton resigned; and how to find the balance between authority and approachability. The focus is on practical tips and actions to improve, with many case examples that help to clarify where you can go wrong. <p>Harvey Schachter, Special to <i>The Globe and Mail</i></p><p> --The Globe and Mail<br><br>When Cesar Millan, known on TV as the Dog Whisperer, walks into a room full of canines, the four-legged followers know immediately that he's in charge. His voice, his posture and his gestures all convey his top-dog status. But Cara Hale Alter says the two-legged beasts of the world also could learn a thing or two from Millan. Alter, founder and president of SpeechSkills, says that one of the clear things that puts Millan in charge is his lack of head movement. This level-headed position is one of the best ways that Millan conveys his "executive presence" to a pack of dogs exactly what we should be doing in our careers if we want to convey the same thing to the workplace pack, she says. Alter, whose SpeechSkills is a San Francisco-based communications training company, says many people are unaware of such subtle clues. But she has done research on how we all can do a better job of establishing our authority and capability and put it in a new book, The Credibility Code. "Many people are unaware of the negative things they're doing," she says. "They don't understand how their image is being formed by the way they move or speak." Alter offers this advice for those seeking to look more credible: Stop filling in. A stray "um," "uh" or "you know" can make you sound unsure. Instead, don't be afraid to pause while you search for the next word. Don't sound like a teenager. Ending a statement with an upward rise of the voice used to be common among teenagers but has filtered into adult conversation, Alter says. This "up talk" is easy to pick up, so make sure you haven't adopted the bad habit. Try reading an article out loud, making sure you end statement with a downward inflection of your voice. Control your space. Just as Millan conveys authority with little head movement, you can convey more personal power by controlling a tendency to shift your weight from leg to leg or bob your head. Such movements comfort you, but Alter says you appear more calm and confident if you're still. At the same time, stop trying to reduce your presence by tucking your arms to your sides, placing your feet close together or dipping your chin. Those kinds of behaviors say that you feel threatened in your space. Open your posture. If you feel nervous, you may start to play with your clothing or jewelry, clasp your hands or wipe any expression off your face. The more gestures and facial expressions you have, the more comfortable and relaxed you appear. Alter suggests going to places such as a farmers' market or a shopping mall and interacting with others to practice your skills. Once you become more comfortable, you'll be able to use those skills in business settings. Maintain eye contact. Don't drop your eyes in a business setting because you appear to step away from the conversation. Give speakers and listeners your full attention. To practice keeping your eyes at horizon level while speaking, put blank Post-It notes on your office wall. Ask yourself questions and then hold your eyes on the notes while you give an answer. Finally, Alter suggests videotaping yourself to spot conversational glitches or habits that may be undermining your credibility. "I've had a lot of people tell me they don't think they have any issues, and then I film them," she says. "Once they see themselves on camera, then they're very eager for coaching.</p><p>Anita Bruzzese, Gannett --USAToday.com</p></p><h2>Twilight: Photographs by Gregory Crewdson</h2><p>Twilight is the magic hour when ordinary routines undergo strange transformations. Gregory Crewdson's Twilight series, begun in 1998 and completed in 2002, consists of forty photographs created as elaborately staged large-scale tableaux that explore the domestic landscape and its relationship to an artificially heightened natural world. The collision between the normal and the paranormal in these narrative images produces a tension that serves to transform the topology of the suburban landscape into a place of wonder and anxiety.<br>As Rick Moody suggests in his essay, Crewdson seems preocupied with "the resection of the suburban ideal, where dream strategies, like condensation and displacement, the action of metaphor, undergird the here and now." Moody's essay reveals as much as it withholds, suggesting the ways that life and memory can be points of entry into art.</p><p>Rick Moody is the author of numerous novels and collections of short stories, including Demonology, Purple America, and The Ice Storm. His work has been published in The New Yorker, Esquire, and Harper&#39;s, among other publications. He lives on Fishers Island, New York.Twilight, that indistinct time between day and night, is an appropriate title for the latest and most substantial monograph by photographer Crewdson (after 1999's Dream of Life and 1998's Hover). Continuing his tradition of photographing cinematically staged and darkened realities of suburban life, Crewdson presents characters who exist in a world where American Beauty meets The X-Files. This volume's 40 images, which were inspired by Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind, were created much like a feature film; the production crew included lighting supervisors, pyrotechnic experts, interior designers, and bug wranglers. Crewdson's fabricated realities contradict the traditional photographic adage of the "decisive moment." In using this method, he demonstrates that the camera can do much more than capture a moment in time, thus placing this work in the vanguard of contemporary art photography. The book begins with an essay by novelist Moody and ends with production stills and credits. Recommended for all public and academic collections. Shauna Frischkorn, Millersville Univ.

Key among these are: making observations, asking questions and exercising logical reasoning in deriving answers to those questions. Within each lesson, teachers/homeschoolers will find &#34;signposts&#34; that direct them in bringing students to exercise these and other practices that are crucial, not only to science, but to every other profession and countless aspects of everyday life as well. Students completing the BFSU curriculum will have the knowledge and skills prerequisite for any high school AP science course plus the understanding necessary to contribute positively toward implementing solutions to problems of the day. The Building Foundations of Scientific Understanding volumes are only part of the package. For no additional charge, the author provides an online support/help service.

For his first project, he proposed a series of pictures about the gang wars that were then plaguing Harlem, believing that if he could draw attention to the problem then perhaps it would be addressed through social programs or government intervention. As a result of his efforts, Parks gained the trust of one particular group of gang members and their leader, Leonard Red Jackson, and produced a series of pictures of them that are artful, emotive, poignant, touching and sometimes shocking. From this larger body of work, 21 pictures were selected for reproduction in a graphic and adventurous layout in <i>Life</i> magazine. At each step of the selection process--as Parks chose each shot, or as the picture editors at <i>Life</i> re-selected from his selection--any intended narrative was complicated by another curatorial voice. Featuring contact sheets, proof prints and the published <i>Life</i> article, <i>Gordon Parks: The Making of an Argument</i> traces this editorial process and parses out the various voices and motives behind the production of the picture essay.

We all long for true intimacy. Many people seek to fill that void by seeking sexual relationships-whether real or fantasized-that promise to provide the relief, acceptance, and fulfillment for which they long. But it is false intimacy.

This is a language where &#x2018;cleave&#x2019; can mean to cut in half or to hold two halves together; where the simple word &#x2018;set&#x2019; has 126 different meanings as a verb, 58 as a noun, and 10 as a participial adjective; where if you can run fast you are moving swiftly, but if you are stuck fast you are not moving at all; [and] where &#x2018;colonel,&#x2019; &#x2018;freight,&#x2019; &#x2018;once,&#x2019; and &#x2018;ache&#x2019; are strikingly at odds with their spellings.&#x201d; As a copy editor for the London<i> Times</i> in the early 1980s, Bill Bryson felt keenly the lack of an easy-to-consult, authoritative guide to avoiding the traps and snares in English, and so he brashly suggested to a publisher that he should write one.

The heroes, of course, are the youngest characters in the book. The descriptive prose is as spare and unambiguous as an old-fashioned interactive computer game-think "Zork," from the 1970s. "[The stairway] was made of wood, with a creaky old railing beside it. The walls were worn metal, stained and weathered by time." But the book contains enough fight scenes for several issues of a Marvel comic, and they're joyously inventive. People reveal their characters by the way they fight. A tiny girl with the ability to teleport wins fights by running away, over and over again, until the other person is exhausted; she's the Rabbit. These confrontations aren't described with the clarity Lee and Moore use to talk about the settings. Readers may have to look at a few passages twice to figure out just who hit whom. Fortunately, Tong loves drawing battle scenes. Pages and pages are crammed with energetic black-and-white drawings of people bounding around the room. But the characters are so engaging that the scenes where they're joking around and telling ridiculous stories are more entertaining than the battle sequences. The prose may be too bare-bones for some readers, but the surprises are genuine, and the cliffhangers will bring people back for the next adventure. (Adventure. 8-12) Kirkus"<br><br>Gr 4-7 In legendary comic creator Lee's first prose novel, two factions, each comprised of people who harness animal power from the Chinese zodiac, fight to control the fate of the world. While visiting a museum in China, Steven Lee's life changes forever when he follows his mysterious tour guide's screams for help, leading him to a secret room where Maxwell, a power hungry war contractor, accidentally releases an ancient zodiac power into the world. Now equipped with the aggressive fighting prowess of the Tiger, Steven teams up with Jasmine, the fake tour guide who has been fighting Maxwell's group for years, to travel the world and find the other hosts. Along with a feisty singer, a brawler from Ireland, a techie, and an extremely shy girl, Steven must learn to control his powers in order to defeat Maxwell. The first installment in a planned trilogy, Zodiac has everything readers would expect from Stan Lee: plenty of action, a fast-paced plot, a villain who is driven more by misguided ideals than pure evil, and a group of young, ordinary people trying to make sense of their newfound powers. Illustrations by Tong, known for his work on superhero comics in the UK, add to the book's appeal. A cliff-hanger ending leaves readers wanting more. Give this to superhero enthusiasts and fans of adventure stories; it will fly off the shelves. Marissa Lieberman, East Orange Public Library, NJ SLJ"<br><br>3Q 5P M After the death of his beloved grandfather, teenager Steven Lee is sent to Hong Kong by his parents who want him to become more knowledgeable about his Chinese-American heritage. Here, during an unexceptional class field trip to the New China Heritage Museum, something extraordinary happens when he breaks away from the group to investigate an unusual sound. There, in the museum's sub-basement, he witnesses the frightening transformative power created by the combination of ancient artifacts and modern technology. This discovery initiates Steven's inclusion in an international group of young people who have been recruited to stop the power-hungry Maxwell and his manic mercenaries from accomplishing world domination. Using the fascinating mythology of the Chinese zodiac as the plot device that drives the story, the authors have created a world in which the powers of twelve unique animals can be transferred to a select group of people. The characters that are destined to use the powers are extremely stereotypical; however, instead of being offensive and off-putting, this heavy-handed typecasting comes across as familiar and comical. This is understandable, as the text reads like a verbal description of a detailed visual. Basically, the narrative is a running description of the characters, setting, and action that would be found in each illustrated panel of a comic book. Action-packed and heavily illustrated, this first book in a projected series should appeal to middle school students who are fans of Stan Lee, anime, graphic novels, superheroes, and the works of Rick Riordan.-Lynne Farrell Stover. VOYA"<br><br>Lee, the famed co-creator of such Marvel superheroes as Spider-Man and the X-Men, presents his first novel. Kicking off the Zodiac Legacy series, this action-driven outing is very much what his fans might expect. Chinese-American 14-year-old Steven Lee, on an educational tour of Hong Kong, stumbles on a secret plot to control the super powers of the Chinese Zodiac, perpetrated by Maxwell, a mercenary general seeking world domination. Steven accidentally gains the power of the Tiger and is immediately drawn into an emerging group of zodiac-powered young heroes dedicated to stopping Maxwell and his band of similarly zodiac-enhanced thugs. As the two sides race around the globe to corral the remaining powers and their wielders, Lee and Moore deliver desperate chases, bombastic banter, and increasing spectacular confrontations, albeit with a tendency toward over- description ("Maxwell reached out and backhanded her across the face. His hand swept through the air, leaving a trail of Dragon fire in its wake"). This frenetic light adventure should please readers who already love the Marvel universe and nurse their own dreams of superpowered glory. Final art not seen by PW. Ages 8 12. PW"<br><br>Fourteen-year-old Steven Lee considers himself an average Asian American teen, so when he stumbles upon a mystical ceremony deep in the bowels of a Hong Kong museum, he has no idea how to handle the apparent superpowers on display. And once drawn into the ceremony, Steven surprisingly discovers ancient powers-those of the tiger in the Chinese zodiac-rising in himself. Fleeing the evil Dragon Maxwell, Steven aligns himself with Jasmine and Carlos to seek out others being captured by released zodiac superpowers. He persuades them to Jasmine's side even as he questions her ability to lead. This is legendary Stan Lee's first novel (the initial title in a proposed trilogy for middle-schoolers), and he has created an intriguing new set of superhuman-both good and evil-who are empowered by the creatures in the Chinese zodiac. What the story lacks in character development will likely not be missed by readers, who are pulled along with Steven from one confrontation to the next. Enhances by Tong's punchy illustrations, this novel will be in high demand from graphic-novel readers and movie fans alike. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: What's hotter right now than comic book superheroes? The myth of Lee, a Marvel Comics icon, speaks for itself, and the promotional engine for this is already at light speed. Melissa Moore Booklist"<br><br>When fourteen-year-old American Steven Lee wanders away on a class trip through a Hong Kong museum, he uncovers a secret chamber where scientists are embed- ding the mystical powers of the Chinese Zodiac into maniacal military contractor Maxwell. Steven's unexpected arrival derails the procedure, though, and when two other intruders start a skirmish, the power of the Tiger finds its way into Steven instead. At the same time, other mystical animal energies manage to escape, and Steven is drawn into a battle to stop Maxwell from recapturing them. Now Steven and his two new compatriots are off on a worldwide adventure to discover other young people turned superhero by the Zodiac energy, to convince them to join the fight against Maxwell and his team of warriors, and to save the world. Jam-packed with action scenes and characters with imaginatively conceived powers, this addition to a growing genre of superhero novels will garner a new generation of fans for the venerable Stan Lee. The first in a planned series, the story unfolds along conventional lines-teams gathered, powers explained, battle lines drawn-but offers additional complexity as characters choose which side to join. Steven is the only real kid in the fairly large and diverse cast, and the story isn't always his; the narrative always comes back around to him, though and readers will likely appreciate seeing a teen holding his own against and alongside adults. He's also an engaging hero to root for, equal parts confused adolescent and born leader. Ultimately fun, and at times funny, this is a strong superhero-team story for readers not ready for the bleaker realities of Sanderson's Steelheart (BCCB 1/14) but who want something more complex than Disney's Big Hero 6.

Lisle lives with her husband in northwestern Connecticut and Westchester County, New York.<b>Chapter One: Sun Prairie</b><br>Late in the autumn of 1887, the <i>Sun Prairie Countryman,</i> a rural Wisconsin newspaper, briefly noted that a baby girl had arrived two days before on Tuesday, November 15, in the farmhouse of Ida and Francis O'Keeffe. The birth, assisted by a country doctor in the O'Keeffe home, was the second for the young couple. The twenty-three-year-old Ida named her infant Georgia Totto for her patrician Hungarian grandfather, George Totto. Georgia, it appeared, would have Ida's dark hair, and her round face was pure Irish, like her father's. The variegated pigment of her eyes suggested the mingled bloodlines of brown-eyed maternal forebears and blue-eyed paternal ones.<br>Georgia was born into a rapidly industrializing world. The country's longest suspension bridge, linking Brooklyn to Manhattan, had recently opened, and the Eiffel Tower in Paris was still under construction, due to be completed in two years. The American government in Washington, under the reformist leadership of President Grover Cleveland, was attempting to exert some control over capitalist monopolies and to bring order to the grim, oppressive factories where immigrant laborers often erupted into violence and strikes. But in the western part of the country, the last great Indian war was still to be fought against federal troops.<br>Little of this turmoil affected the pastoral life on the Sun Prairie farm, however. It remained like farm life everywhere, suspended in a timeless ritual governed by the rhythms of nature. The newborn baby was kept indoors during the long, dark, icy northern winter. When the snow finally melted, the sunlight became warm, and the prairie was touched by the bright green of spring, Georgia was carried outside for the first time. She was placed on a handmade patchwork quilt spread on the new grass and propped up by pillows. Those very first moments of seeing in the brilliant sunlight became indelibly etched in her memory: She precisely remembered the quilt's patterns of flowers on black and tiny red stars as well as the startling blond looks of her mother's friend.<br>Yet another perception during those minutes in the pool of yellow sunshine was not so pleasant. Georgia, less than a year old, was acutely aware that two other children playing on the patterned quilt were getting all the admiration. One of them was her older brother, Francis Jr., two years old, the firstborn child with dark Totto eyes, who was adorable in his mama's eyes. When he was born, weighing a plump ten and a half pounds, it had been heralded as a grand event by the <i>Countryman.</i> As Georgia crawled around the cotton quilt, she felt a sharp sting of neglect. "Why doesn't anyone think <i>I'm</i> beautiful?" she recalled wondering many years later. She squirmed off the quilt, she remembered, and was impatiently thrust back onto it.<br><br>Georgia's was a uniquely American heritage -- three of her grandparents were immigrants, and the fourth was descended from one of the earliest colonists in the New World. Her O'Keeffe grandparents had settled in Sun Prairie first during the initial large wave of immigration to America. Pierce O'Keeffe and his wife, Catherine Mary, and other family members left for the American frontier when their family wool business in Ireland faltered. They arrived in Milwaukee through the chain of Great Lakes, then traveled directly west by oxcart for about eighty miles inland to the young settlement of Sun Prairie in the southern part of the state. In July 1848 Pierce O'Keeffe bought his first acres along the Koshkonong Creek from the federal government for less than a dollar an acre. As he turned Virgin forest into rolling farmland, his wife, Kate, gave birth to four sons: Boniface, Peter, Francis, and Bernard.<br>The O'Keeffes began to homestead just two months after Wisconsin ceased being a territory and entered the union as a state. Meanwhile, the last of the Winnebago Indians were being driven westward as the arriving farmers cut down the thick forests, plowed the hunting trails under, and decimated the deer. More and more land was being laid out in neatly numbered lots, and roads increasingly followed the straight lines of the surveyor's measure. At the same time, railroads were inching into the newly settled regions to transport the wheat harvests and the iron ore to other parts of the country. <br>About ten years after the O'Keeffes had settled in Sun Prairie in 1848, George Victor Totto and his wife bought land next to the O'Keeffe farm. Whereas the Irish family had emigrated to Wisconsin because of a business failure in the old country, George Totto had fled to America because of his belief in liberty. A count from Budapest, he had fought in a doomed Hungarian uprising against Austrian rule as an aide-de-camp to the revolutionary hero Lajos Kossuth. Family legend has it that Totto was ransomed from jail with the family jewels. In any case, he escaped to America and wound up in Sauk City, Wisconsin, later known as Prairie de Sac, where another Hungarian political refugee of a flamboyant stripe had bought land.<br>Totto's wife, Isabel, prided herself on her heritage as well. One of her granddaughters later uncovered many European coats of arms designed for both grandparents' families. Her roots, as deep as any in America, could be traced to a Dutchman who arrived in New York in 1637. Two hundred years later, one of his descendants, Charles Wyckoff , fathered Isabel and her younger sister Jane. Wyckoff, a hotelkeeper in the East, apparently had business troubles, and, after his wife died, he moved with his teen-age daughters and a new wife to Sauk City to try his luck at running a hotel on the frontier. Wyckoff hadn't been in Wisconsin long when a cholera epidemic broke out. Although he made plans to move his family out, a day before their departure he came down with the disease and died shortly afterwards.<br>It was in Sauk City that the exiled George Totto and the orphaned Isabel Wyckoff met and fell in love. In the twenty-five-year-old Isabel's eyes, the pedigreed Hungarian patriot ten years her senior was a cut above the other marriage prospects on the frontier. Formal photographs show that Totto was a thin-lipped, rather homely man with a light brown beard and that Isabel with her long, raw-boned face, could never have been called pretty. The poise and good breeding of the tall, dark-haired girl with the eastern education appealed to the European, and in May 1855 the two were married.<br>A year after the wedding their first child, Alletta, was born. Her birth was followed in rapid succession by those of Josephine, Charles, Ida, Leonore, and George. Meanwhile, the Tottos had moved to Sun Prairie, where the 1870 census revealed that their farm was larger and more abundant than the neighboring O'Keeffe property. But farming in the harsh midwestern climate proved too difficult for George and Isabel. In the 1870s Totto gave up and returned to Hungary, supposedly to claim his share of the family fortune. Totto may have visited his family in Wisconsin again, but he eventually died in his homeland, still worshiped, in absentia, by his daughters. Left to fend for themselves, Isabel and her six sons and daughters moved to nearby Madison in the early 1880s. The town had been a high-brow university town for more than forty years, and she must have imagined that it held better prospects for her children.<br><br>Georgia's father, Francis Calixtus O'Keeffe, was around thirty when he began to drive his mother's buggy the twelve miles to Madison to court the fourth Totto child, Ida Ten Eyck, a poised, brown-eyed teenager. Frank had known Ida all his life as the little girl on the neighboring farm. Now Ida had grown tall like her mother and developed a more handsome version of her mother's dark looks. Frank was a wiry, good-natured farmer with fair Irish skin and curly hair. His schooling had stopped in adolescence when his father died and he had to help his mother and brothers run the farm. Then in October 1883, the brother closest in age, Peter, died of tuberculosis. It is likely that his brothers death startled Frank into the realization that his life was rapidly passing, because about this time he proposed to Ida.<br>Ida's family favored the match, partly because Frank wanted to buy the Totto pastures in Sun Prairie. But Ida's two older sisters weren't married, and she had little inclination to wed and return to her childhood home of Sun Prairie, a simple farm community of a few hundred people without even a library. Ida was a serious girl who kept a diary, loved books, and dreamed of becoming a doctor. It was also commonplace at the time to avoid marriage to someone with tuberculosis in the family in the mistaken belief that the highly infectious disease was hereditary. Ida, however, was young, obedient, and fond of Frank, so she reluctantly accepted his proposal. A few weeks after she turned twenty, they were married. The Sun Prairie newspaper carried the announcement:<br>Wedded -- At the residence of the bride's mother, in the city of Madison, on Tuesday, Feb. 19, 1884, by the Rev. J. B. Pratt, Mr. Francis O'Keeffe of Sun Prairie to Miss Ida Totto, of Madison. The contracting parties in the nuptial affair above chronicled are well and favorably known hereabouts, and the best wishes of the community are extended to Frank and his charming bride.<br>The Tottos considered themselves to be a notch above the O'Keeffes because of their lineage and cultivation, and the wedding was entirely a Totto affair. Although Frank was a Roman Catholic, the Tottos' Episcopal clergyman officiated. And even though either of Frank's two brothers could have signed the marriage certificate, an older brother and sister of Ida's were the witnesses. Throughout their marriage Frank would appear to be in Ida's shadow, even though he was eleven years older than she. People often echoed Ida's early doubts and wondered why a woman who carried herself like an aristocrat had married a humble Irishman.<br><br>After the wedding, Ida had no more time to pen her thoughts in her diary. Within six months she was pregnant, and for the next eight years she was either pregnant or nursing an infant. Interestingly, only the births of the first two, Francis and Georgia, were entered into the public record. A few weeks before Georgia's second birthday a sister was born, named Ida Ten Eyck for their mother. Sixteen months later another sister arrived: Anita Natalie, with a tiny round face and large dark eyes. And when Anita was only sixteen months old a brother, Alexius Wyckoff, was born.<br>Ida, as a mother, above all enjoyed spending evenings and Sunday afternoons reading to her little children. In her enthusiasm for books, Mama seemed to make them come alive, Georgia recalled many afterwards, and she adored listening to the warm, glowing tones of her mothers beautiful, well-bred voice. Since the stories were picked for the benefit of her eldest, Francis, the first ones that Georgia heard were boys' books such as James Fenimore Cooper's <i>Leatherstocking Tales</i> about pioneer days and cowboy-and-Indian adventures in the state of Texas and the New Mexico territory.<br>Reading aloud was one of the ways that Ida showed her interest in the mental development of her offspring -- the daughters as well as the sons. Education for women was a family tradition: Her own mother had been educated in the East, her sisters had become schoolteachers, and she had joined a group of Sun Prairie women with intellectual and charitable interests who gave themselves the lofty name of The King's Daughters. Furthermore, Ida took great interest in the curriculum of the nearby schoolhouse, and the schoolteacher usually boarded with the O'Keeffes. Ida quietly had high expectations for her daughters. "Our mother had a very good opinion of herself, and she wanted all of us to be the same way," Georgia told a younger sister later. When in time mama tried to provide the girls with private schools and special lessons, she was motivated, in part, by her own disappointment at having ended her schooling too soon as well as by her desire that her daughters be able to care for themselves. Since all of Ida's daughters but one became professional women, her influence on them is evident. What's more, since they also had an extremely low birthrate -- only producing two children among the five of them -- it's likely that they also sensed her dissatisfaction with domesticity.<br>In fact, Ida seemed to spend more time cultivating her children's minds than cuddling them in an affectionate, maternal way. That kind of mothering apparently was taken over by others in the large household, particularly by Ida's aunt, Jane Varney. Aunt Jenny, as she was known, had been a teen-aged bride when she went to California during the Gold Rush in a covered wagon. But she soon was widowed and returned to Wisconsin on a sailing ship via Cape Horn to help care for the children of her sister Isabel. When her niece, Ida, gave birth to her first child, Aunt Jenny moved to the O'Keeffe household and oversaw it with a stern eye for the rest of her life. The presence of the small, alert woman (some said a busybody) in the family freed Ida to continue to pursue her quest for self-education, and gave her the chance to visit her mother and friends in Madison frequently and even to go to the opera in Milwaukee on occasion.<br><br>By the time Georgia was a four-and-a-half-year-old solemn brown-haired girl -- remembered by one of her teachers as a "little, dark-skinned, wide-eyed, spritelike child" -- she had four brothers and sisters to compete with in the struggle for the grown-ups' attention. She believed that her goodlooking older brother was her mother's favorite, and that her affectionate little sister, Ida, was the other family pet. Whether or not those perceptions were true, Georgia adapted her early behavior to them and remained convinced of them all her life. But because of the numbers of grandmothers, aunts, and uncles in the extended family, Georgia apparently got all the attention she needed, which was probably less than that required by the ordinary child in any case. "I was not a favorite child, but I didn't mind at all," she insisted many years later.<br>Until the death of Grandmother Totto -- when Georgia, her eldest granddaughter, was six -- the girl used to visit the Totto household on the edge of Madison's Lake Monona, where her maiden aunts and bachelor uncles lived. Georgia probably knew best her Grandmother O'Keeffe, who lived on the adjoining farm until the age of eighty-five, when Georgia was almost ten. Both her grandmothers -- the deserted Grandmother Totto and the widowed Grandmother O'Keeffe -- were strong matriarchs who had kept their large families together after the loss of their men. In Sun Prairie Kate O'Keeffe was highly respected for her sharp intelligence and deeply loved for her sweet nature, according to her lengthy obituaries. The two women, along with Georgia's mother, were part of that tradition of capable frontier women: They sewed the family clothes, preserved the food, decorated the home, nursed the sick, taught the young, and, in general, nourished life in all its forms. In time, Georgia herself would be called the expression of these women's creative spirit.<br>Born agile and alert with pretty hands, Georgia was a quiet child, who, one imagines, walked long before she talked while always intently observing everything around her. Her earliest years were spent stoically tagging along behind her brother, who was a year and a half older. Soon it was evident that she had advantages in her rivalry with him. He had weak eyes and her keen sight didn't miss a thing. She was also naturally athletic and before long she was outrunning and outclimbing him. Georgia thought about it carefully and came to the conclusion that she was better than her brother -- ...</p><h2>Dr. John&#39;s Healing Psoriasis Cookbook</h2><p><p> <b>Over 300 kitchen-tested recipes designed for the psoriasis, eczema, and psoriatic-arthritic patient, plus the latest nutritional facts for everyone!</b><br> &nbsp;</p> <p> Foreword by Annemarie Colbin, C.H.E.S. and Founder of The Natural Gourmet Institute, New York<br> &nbsp;</p> <p> Statistics show that more than 100 million people worldwide suffer from the chronic skin disease psoriasis.

A pervert, through and through." We may not want to admit it, but as the award-winning columnist and psychologist Jesse Bering reveals in <i>Perv</i>, there is a spectrum of perversion along which we all sit. Whether it's voyeurism, exhibitionism, or your run-of-the-mill foot fetish, we <i>all</i> possess a suite of sexual tastes as unique as our fingerprints&#x2015;and as secret as the rest of the skeletons we've hidden in our closets.</p><p>Combining cutting-edge studies and critiques of landmark research and conclusions drawn by Sigmund Freud, Alfred Kinsey, and the <i>DSM-5</i>, Bering pulls the curtain back on paraphilias, arguing that sexual deviance is commonplace. He explores the countless fetishists of the world, including people who wear a respectable suit during the day and handcuff a willing sexual partner at night. But he also takes us into the lives of "erotic outliers," such as a woman who falls madly in love with the Eiffel Tower; a pair of <i>deeply </i>affectionate identical twins; those with a particular penchant for statues; and others who are enamored of crevices <i>not </i>found on the human body. </p><p>Moving from science to politics, psychology, history, and his own reflections on growing up gay in America, Bering confronts hypocrisy, prejudice, and harm as they relate to sexuality on a global scale. Humanizing so-called deviants while at the same time asking serious questions about the differences between thought and action, he presents us with a challenge: to understand that our best hope of solving some of the most troubling problems of our age hinges entirely on the <i>amoral </i>study of sex.</p><p>As kinky as it is compassionate, illuminating, and engrossing, <i>Perv </i>is an irresistible and deeply personal book. "I can't promise you an orgasm at the end of our adventure," Bering writes, "but I <i>can</i> promise you a better understanding of why you get the ones you do."</p></p><p><b>Jesse Bering</b> is the author of <i>The Belief Instinct </i>and <i>Why Is the Penis</i> <i>Shaped Like That? </i>His writing and research have appeared in <i>Slate</i>, <i>Scientific American</i>, <i>New York</i> magazine, <i>Cosmopolitan</i>, <i>The Guardian</i>, and <i>The</i> <i>New Republic</i>, among other publications, and have been featured by NPR, Playboy Radio, and more.

He lives in Ithaca, New York.WE&#x2019;RE ALL PERVERTS <br> <i>Gnothi seauton</i> [Know thyself] &#x2014;Inscription outside the Temple of Apollo at Delphi <br>You are a sexual deviant. A pervert, through and through. <br> Now, now, don&#x2019;t get so defensive. Allow me to explain. Imagine if some all-powerful arm of the government existed solely to document every sexual response of every private citizen. From the most tempestuous orgasmic excesses, to the slightest twinges of genitalia, to unseen hormonal cascades and sub-cranial machinations, not a thing is missed. Filed under your name in this fictional scientific universe would be your very own scandalous dossier, intricate and exhaustive in its every embarrassing measurement of your self-lubricating loins. What&#x2019;s more, the records in this nightmarish society extend all the way back to your adolescence, to the days when your desires first began to simmer and boil. I&#x2019;d be willing to bet that buried somewhere in this relentless biography of yours is an undeniable fact of your sex life that would hobble you instantaneously with shame should the wrong individual ever find out about it. <br> To break the ice, I&#x2019;ll go first. And how I wish one of my first sexual experiences were as charming as inserting my phallus into a warm apple pie. Instead, it involves pleasuring myself to an image from my father&#x2019;s old anthropology textbook. This isn&#x2019;t even as admirable as those puerile stories about a teenage boy masturbating to some <i>National Geographic</i>&#x2013;like spread of exotic naked villagers breast-feeding or shooting blow darts in the Amazon. No, it wasn&#x2019;t anything like that. For me, the briefest of heavens could instead be found in an enormous and hairy representative of the species <i>Homo neanderthalensis</i>. I can still see the lifelike rendering now. The Neanderthal was shown crouching down, pink gonads dangling teasingly between muscular apish thighs, while with all his cognitive might this handsome, grunting beast tried desperately to light a fire in a cobbled pit to warm his equally hirsute family (what looked to be a perplexed woman from whose furry breasts a baby feverishly suckled). The Neanderthal was in fact too brutish for my tastes, but in those pre-Internet days he was the only naked man I had at my fingertips. Well, the only naked hominid, anyway. One must work with the material one has. <br>So there, I said it. In my adolescence, I derived an intense orgasm (or twenty) from fantasizing about a member of another species. (In my defense, it <i>was</i> a closely related species.) You may have to rack your brains for some similarly indecent memory, or then again, maybe all you need to do is roll over in bed this morning to remind yourself of the hairy specimen of a creature that <i>you</i> brought home last night. Either way, chances are there&#x2019;s something gossip-worthy in your own sexual past. Maybe it&#x2019;s not quite as odd as mine. But I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s suitably humbling for present purposes. What makes us all the same is our having had certain private moments that could get us blackmailed. <br> Granted, most of us will never share our own lurid tidbits about our most unusual masturbatory mental aids or the fact that there&#x2019;s a distinct possibility we had the tongue of a Sasquatch in our nether regions last night (or ours in its). What usually gets out is only what we want others to know. That&#x2019;s perfectly understandable. We have our reputations to consider. I might never be allowed again into my local museum for fear I&#x2019;ll debase one of the caveman mannequins, for instance. The problem with zipping up on our dirtiest little secrets, however, is that others are doing exactly the same thing, and this means that the story of human sexuality that we&#x2019;ve come to believe is true is, in reality, a lie. What&#x2019;s more, it&#x2019;s a very dangerous lie, because it convinces us that we&#x2019;re all alone in the world as &#x201c;perverts&#x201d; (and hence immoral monsters) should we ever deviate in some way from this falsely conceived pattern of the normal. A lot of human nature has escaped rational understanding because we&#x2019;ve been unwilling to be completely honest about what <i>really</i> turns us on and off&#x2014;or at least what&#x2019;s managed to do the trick for us before. We cling to facades. We know one another only partially. Much of what lies ahead, therefore, concerns what you don&#x2019;t want the rest of the world to know about your sexuality. But relax, that will be our little secret. <br> Again, however, I&#x2019;d urge you to come clean in the confession booth of your own mind. And really, just a small unburdening of your erotic conscience will do for now. Reach far, far into the abyss of your wettest of dreams. Or perhaps it was only a fleeting, long-forgotten secretion, a lingering gaze misplaced, a furtive whiff of an object redolent with someone you once craved, a wayward click of the mouse, a hypothalamic effervescence that made you tingle down below. Nevertheless, even if you settle on one of these relatively minor examples, each embodies a corporeal reality specific to <i>you</i>&nbsp;&#x2026; a &#x201c;shocking,&#x201d; incontrovertible deed of physiology or an outright commission of lust that you&#x2019;ve never shared with a single person, maybe not even yourself until now. <br> Whatever it is, once it&#x2019;s laid bare for all the world to see in your declassified government report, a faultless testimony in inerasable ink, this unique venereal data point will undoubtedly register in the consciousness of someone, somewhere out there as evidence of your sexual deviance, or perhaps even your criminality. Just look around you or think of all the people you know. In the unforgiving lair of another&#x2019;s critical eyes, you have now been transformed irreversibly into a filthy, loathsome pervert. And <i>that&#x2019;s</i> the feeling, this fetid social emotion of shame, that I want you to keep in the back of your mind as you read this book. We&#x2019;re going to get to the bottom of where it comes from, and we&#x2019;re going to do our best to smother it with reason in our efforts to stop it from hurting you and others in the future. <br> This feeling doesn&#x2019;t just make you a guilty pervert; more important, it makes you a human being. Blue-haired grandmothers, somnambulant schoolteachers, meticulous bankers, and scowling librarians, they&#x2019;ve felt it too, just like you. We tend not to think of others as sexual entities unless they&#x2019;ve aroused us somehow, but with the exception of those people spared by certain chromosomal disorders, we&#x2019;re all innately lewd organisms. That&#x2019;s easy to grasp in some abstract sense. But try putting it into practice. The next time you&#x2019;re at the grocery store and the moribund cashier with the underbite and the debilitating bosom sweeps your bananas across the scanner, think of precisely where those uncommonly large hands have been. How many men or women&#x2014; <i>including</i> her&#x2014;have those seemingly asexual appendages brought ineffable bliss? This isn&#x2019;t an exercise in the grotesque; it&#x2019;s a reminder of your animal humanity. A concupiscent beast has roamed under all skins&nbsp;&#x2026; even that of the grumpy checkout lady. <br> Yet the best-kept secret is even bigger than this unspoken universality. It&#x2019;s this: exploring the outer recesses of desire by using the tools of science is a pinnacle human achievement. It&#x2019;s not easy, but digging into the darkest corners of our sexual nature (that is to say, our &#x201c;perversions&#x201d;) can expose what keeps us from making real moral progress whenever the issues of equality and sexual diversity arise. With each defensive layer we remove, the rats therein will flee at the daylight falling at their feet, and the opportunity to eradicate such a pestilence of fear and ignorance makes the excavation of our species&#x2019;s lascivious soul worth our getting a little dirty along the way. <br> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br> We&#x2019;re not the first to use the grimier realities of human sexuality to grease our way into some deeper truths. They may not have been scientists, but many artists and writers have touched on related psychological processes that were insightful and even foretold future research directions. In his 1956 play, <i>The Balcony</i>, for example, the French playwright Jean Genet showed how people who are inebriated by desire experience cognitive distortions motivating them to engage in behaviors that in a less aroused state of mind they&#x2019;d perceive as obscene. Genet&#x2019;s story revolves around the daily affairs of a busy brothel in a town on the brink of war. Run by an astute madam named Irma, the whorehouse is a sanctuary in which high-profile local officials are free to drain away their carnal excess. Once they&#x2019;ve done so, they can get on with the business of being &#x201c;normal&#x201d; and respectable public figures defending the town from the enemy. Irma&#x2019;s house of illusions has come to serve some colorful patrons, including the town judge, who feigns to &#x201c;punish&#x201d; a naughty prostitute, a bishop who pretends to &#x201c;absolve the sins&#x201d; of a demure penitent, and a general who enjoys riding his favorite (human) horse. &#x201c;When it&#x2019;s over, their minds are clear,&#x201d; Irma reflects after these men visit her establishment. &#x201c;I can tell from their eyes. Suddenly they understand mathematics. They love their children and their country.&#x201d; The lustful human brain, Genet understood in a way that contemporary scientists are just now starting to fully grasp by using controlled studies in laboratory settings, is simply not of the same world as that of its sober counterpart. <br> One point I&#x2019;d like to make crystal clear at the outset of our journey is that <i>understanding</i> is not the same as <i>condoning</i>. Our sympathies can take us only so far, and entering other minds isn&#x2019;t pleasant when it comes to certain categories of sex offenders. Furthermore, it&#x2019;s one thing to wax theoretical about sexual deviance, but another altogether to be the victim of sex abuse in real life or to know that someone we love, especially a child, has been harmed. Yet while it&#x2019;s a common refrain to liken the most violent sex offenders to animals, whether we like it or not, even the worst of them are resoundingly human. As unsettling as it can sometimes be to lean in for a closer look, their lives can offer us valuable lessons about what can go wrong in the development of a person&#x2019;s sexual identity and decision making. &#x201c;I consider nothing that is human alien to me,&#x201d; said the Roman philosopher Terence. I feel the same way. And Terence&#x2019;s credo is one I intend to adhere to closely when it comes to some of the characters we&#x2019;ll be meeting along the way. <br> I&#x2019;ll do my best, anyway. For while there&#x2019;s no doubt that the most terrible rapists, child molesters, and other more banal classes of sex offenders were around in his day, Terence didn&#x2019;t know of the hundreds of extravagant &#x201c;paraphilias&#x201d; (or sexual orientations toward people or things that most of us wouldn&#x2019;t consider to be particularly erotic) that scientists would eventually discover when he confidently uttered those words more than two thousand years ago. Even he might have had trouble finding common ground with, say, &#x201c;teratophiles,&#x201d; those attracted to the congenitally deformed, or &#x201c;autoplushophiles,&#x201d; who enjoy masturbating to their own image as cartoonlike stuffed animals. <br> Understanding the etymology of the word &#x201c;pervert,&#x201d; oddly enough, can help us to frame many of the challenging issues to come. Perverts weren&#x2019;t always the libidinous bogeymen we know and loathe today. Yes, sexual mores have shifted dramatically over the course of history and across societies, but the very word &#x201c;pervert&#x201d; once literally meant something else entirely than what it does now. For example, it wouldn&#x2019;t have helped his case, but the peculiar discovery that some peasant during the reign of Charles II used conch shells for anal gratification or inhaled a stolen batch of ladies&#x2019; corsets while touching himself in the town square would have been merely coincidental to any accusations of his being perverted. Terms of the day such as &#x201c;skellum&#x201d; (scoundrel) or reference to his &#x201c;mundungus&#x201d; (smelly entrails) might have applied, but calling this man a &#x201c;pervert&#x201d; for his peccadilloes would have made little sense at the time. <br>Linguistically, the sexual connotation feels so natural. The very ring of it&#x2014; <i>purrrvert</i>&#x2014;is at once melodious and cloying, producing a noticeable snarl on the speaker&#x2019;s face as the image of a lecherous child molester, a trench-coated flasher in a park, a drooling pornographer, or perhaps a serial rapist pops into his or her head. Yet as Shakespeare might remind us, a pervert by any other name would smell as foul. <br> For the longest time, in fact, to be a pervert wasn&#x2019;t to be a sex deviant; it was to be an atheist. In 1656, the British lexicographer Thomas Blount included the following entry for the verb &#x201c;pervert&#x201d; in his <i>Glossographia</i> (a book also known by the more cumbersome title <i>A Dictionary Interpreting the Hard Words of Whatsoever Language Now Used in Our Refined English Tongue</i>): &#x201c;to turn upside down, to debauch, or seduce.&#x201d; All of those activities occur in your typical suburban bedroom today. But it&#x2019;s only by dint of our post-Victorian minds that we perceive these types of naughty winks in the definition of a term floating around the old English countryside. In Blount&#x2019;s time, and for several hundred years after he was dead and buried, a pervert was simply a headstrong apostate who had turned his or her back on the draconian morality of the medieval Church, thereby &#x201c;seducing&#x201d; others into a godless lifestyle. <br> Actually, even long before Blount officially introduced perverts to the refined English-speaking world in all their heathen fury, an earlier form of the word appeared in the Catholic mystic Boethius&#x2019;s <i>Consolation of Philosophy</i> in the year 524.* Like Blount&#x2019;s derivation, the mystic&#x2019;s <i>pervertere</i> was a bland &#x201c;turning away from what is right.&#x201d; Given the context of Christian divinity in which Boethius&#x2019;s treatise was written, it&#x2019;s clear that &#x201c;against what is right&#x201d; meant much the same then as it does for God-fearing people today, which is to say, against what is biblical. <br> So if we applied this original definition to the present iconoclastic world of science, one of the world&#x2019;s most recognizable perverts would be the famous evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins. As the author of <i>The God Delusion</i> and an active proselytizer of atheism, Dawkins encourages his fellow rationalists to &#x201c;turn away from&#x201d; canonical religious teachings. (I&#x2019;ve penned my own scientific atheistic screed, so I&#x2019;m not casting stones. I&#x2019;m proudly in possession of a perverted nature that fits both the archaic use of the term, due to my atheism, and its more recent pejorative use, due to my homosexuality.) <br> Only at the tail end of the nineteenth century did the word &#x201c;pervert&#x201d; first leap from the histrionic sermons of fiery preachers into the heady, clinical discourses of stuffy European sexologists like the ones you&#x2019;ll be introduced to soon. And it was a long time after that still before &#x201c;pervert&#x201d;&#x2014;or &#x201c;perv&#x201d; if we&#x2019;re being casual&#x2014;became slang for describing the creepy, bespectacled guy up the road who likes to watch the schoolgirls milling about the bus stop in their miniskirts while he sips tea on his front porch. <br> This semantic migration of perverts, from the church pews to the psychiatric clinic to the online comments section of news stories about sex offenders, hasn&#x2019;t occurred without the clattering bones of medieval religious morality dragging behind. Notice the suffix <i>-vert</i> means, generally, &#x201c;to turn&#x201d;: hence &#x201c;con <i>vert</i>&#x201d; (to turn to another), &#x201c;re <i>vert</i>&#x201d; (to turn to a previous state), &#x201c;in <i>vert</i>&#x201d; (to turn inside out), &#x201c;per <i>vert</i>&#x201d; (to turn away from the right course), and so on. But of all these related words, &#x201c;pervert&#x201d; alone has that devilishly malicious core&#x2014;&#x201c;a distinctive quality of obstinacy,&#x201d; notes the psychoanalyst Jon...</p><h2>Desmond Doss: Conscientious Objector</h2><p>Infantry men who once ridiculed and scoffed at Desmonds simple faith and refusal to carry a weapon owed their lives to him.

For adults only. This was written as a response to reader feedback from my first book Angelic Defenders and Demonic Abusers. It talks about Satanism as a powerful worldwide movement. It talks about the minority of Satanists who practice cannibalism and blood drinking. And it talks about the High-Adept Satanists who are masters of the occult. This book also suggests a connection between Global Satanism and Alien intelligence. Although I am a Christian, I think that persons who believe in other philosophies would also find this book to be of interest. And some Satanists would find my insights to be of interest. Below is a quote from this book. In it I tell the story of a visit I had as a child with two aristocratic cannibals known as the two sisters. For this story I gave them the names of Nancy and Bernie. I made this visit to their mansion with a man who had the nick name of the Baron because he behaved like a robber baron. "After the meal thankfully ended, they took us to see their Satanic temple which they had constructed in their basement. The two sisters took their religion very seriously. So showing us this temple was a big deal for them. And as bizarre as it may sound, in a sense, both the Baron and I felt flattered that they had offered to show it to us. To them, their belief in Satan was very sincere, and to show us their altar was an act of extreme emotional intimacy. Or at least we had thought so when had they invited us. I had seen a number of Luciferian altars by then, and sometimes it had been a pleasant experience. Some Luciferians reveal their inner feelings through their altars, and in some cases they are quite beautiful. On the first floor of the home there was a sturdy wooden door which lead down into the basement. It had a special lock on it. Bernie unlocked it with a key which was hung around her neck. After the door was unlocked, there seemed to be some tension between the Baron and Bernie. The two of them made eye contact and looked at each other intensely. The Baron asked, &#x201c;Are you inviting us in?&#x201d; Bernie answered, &#x201c;You are our guests.&#x201d; She opened the door. &#x201c;You first,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I must insist, you go first,&#x201d; he replied. Bernie entered the dark stairwell. The Baron followed and I was behind him. Nancy brought up the rear. Although Bernie trotted quickly down the stairs, the Baron proceeded slowly. I soon discovered why. The entire staircase was painted flat black, as were the walls. There was a tiny overhead light that shined dimly. But the worse problem wasn&#x2019;t the lighting, the worse problem was the stairs themselves. They were not standard sized stairs. The depth of each stair was too shallow. And the width of each stair was overly narrow. And there were no handrails. It was as if the stairs had been designed to make you tumble down them. Furthermore you couldn&#x2019;t clearly see where you were stepping because the dim lighting and the blackness. It took concentration to figure out where you should step. And sometimes the width and depth of the stairs changed. So the Baron&#x2019;s slow progress down the stairs was filled with tension. Nancy, behind us, kept on chiding us to go faster, but the Baron ignored her. With each thoughtful step that I made, I felt more and more afraid. Before us, about a third of the way down, there was a curtain of red beads. We cautiously pushed through them. Then a bit further down, we faced a second similar curtain of blood red beads. We pushed through them as well. The beads made a slight rattling sound as they closed behind me. A unique smell rose up out of the basement. It smelt of overly perfumed incense and there was a faint rotten smell, like that of dead meat that had been left out for too long. I could feel bile rise in my throat as we proceeded downward. Finally after we pushed through a third red curtain, we found ourselves in the basement. We were stunned by what we saw."</p><p></p><h2>Deadly Class Volume 8: Never Go Back</h2><p>The crew returns to Kings Dominion to discover things have changed in their absence.

The illustrations are fraught with delicious humor and detail. Like its predecessor, perfect for several uses, from picture book hour to beginning reading.&#34;--Kirkus Reviews. Caldecott Honor Medal.</p><p>James Marshall was&nbsp;one of the most prolific and successful author/illustrators of children's books. He was best known for his series on the mischievous exploits of Fox, a debonair, lazy showoff; the uproarious adventures of the two Cut-Ups, Spud and Joe; George and Martha; and the misadventures of the Stupidfamily.&nbsp;He divided his time between an apartment in the Chelsea district of New York and his home in Mansfield Hollow Connecticut.PreSchool-Grade 2 Another delightful romp through the fairy tale forest from the author of Red Riding Hood (Dial, 1987) and James Marshall's Mother Goose (Farrar, 1986) . This retelling is a Victorianesque version of a chubby, blond-hair strong-willed ``naughty little girl'' who takes a shortcut through the woods on her way to buy muffins in the next village, and invades the home of the three sophisticated bears. While the basic storyline may be recognizable to young listeners, sight gags and ironic wit are whimsically employed for those who already know the tale and/or Marshall's other works (for example, a white hen perches atop the bears' house). The tone is straightforward and droll. Marshall is careful to include basic motifs from the original tale: the bowls of porridge, the chairs, and the beds, but he takes liberties in his commentary: ``She walked right in without even bothering to knock'' and in the characters' exclamations, like ``Patooie!'' and ``Egads!'' His playful watercolor illustrations fill the pages in their comic portrayal of these well-known figures. Whether shared in a lap or with a group, this one's a winner.

"I'm sorry," he said quickly. "I didn't mean to startle you." The woman in the dull black overcoat didn't blink and didn't move. "What do you want?" He'd prepared a speech, but he couldn't remember it. "To talk. To you. I want to talk to you." Briar Wilkes closed her eyes hard. When she opened them again, she asked, "Is it about Zeke? What's he done now?" "No, no, it's not about him," he insisted. "Ma'am, I was hoping we could talk about your father." Her shoulders lost their stiff, defensive right angles, and she shook her head. "That figures. I swear to God, all the men in my life, they ..." She stopped herself. And then she said, "My father was a tyrant, and everyone he loved was afraid of him. Is that what you want to hear?" He held his position while she climbed the eleven crooked stairs that led the way to her home, and to him. When she reached the narrow porch he asked, "Is it true?" "More true than not." She stood before him with her fingers wrapped around a ring of keys. The top of her head was level with his chin. Her keys were aimed at his waist, he thought, until he realized he was standing in front of the door. He shuffled out of her way. "How long have you been waiting for me?" she asked. He strongly considered lying, but she pinned him to the wall with her stare. "Several hours. I wanted to be here when you got home." The door clacked, clicked, and scooted inward. "I took an extra shift at the 'works. You could've come back later." "Please, ma'am. May I come inside?" She shrugged, but she didn't say no, and she didn't close him out in the cold, so he followed behind her, shutting the door and standing beside it while Briar found a lamp and lit it. She carried the lamp to the fireplace, where the logs had burned down cold. Beside the mantle there was a poker and a set of bellows, and a flat iron basket with a cache of split logs. She jabbed the poker against the charred lumps and found a few live coals lingering at the bottom. With gentle encouragement, a handful of kindling, and two more lengths of wood, a slow flame caught and held. One arm at a time, Briar pried herself out of the overcoat and left it hanging on a peg. Without the coat, her body had a lean look to it--as if she worked too long, and ate too little or too poorly. Her gloves and tall brown boots were caked with the filth of the plant, and she was wearing pants like a man. Her long, dark hair was piled up and back, but two shifts of labor had picked it apart and heavy strands had scattered, escaping the combs she'd used to hold it all aloft. She was thirty-five, and she did not look a minute younger. In front of the growing, glowing fire there was a large and ancient leather chair. Briar dropped herself into it. "Tell me, Mr ... . I'm sorry. You didn't say your name." "Hale. Hale Quarter. And I must say, it's an honor to meet you." For a moment he thought she was going to laugh, but she didn't. She reached over to a small table beside the chair and retrieved a pouch. "All right, Hale Quarter. Tell me. Why did you wait outside so long in this bitter weather?" From within the pouch she picked a small piece of paper and a large pinch of tobacco. She worked the two together until she had a cigarette, and she used the lamp's flame to coax the cigarette alight. He'd gotten this far by telling the truth, so he risked another confession. "I came when I knew you wouldn't be home. Someone told me that if I knocked, you'd shoot through the peephole." She nodded, and pressed the back of her head against the leather. "I've heard that story, too. It doesn't keep nearly as many folks away as you might expect." He couldn't tell if she was serious, or if her response was a denial. "Then I thank you double, for not shooting me and for letting me come inside." "You're welcome." "May I ... may I take a seat? Would that be all right?" "Suit yourself, but you won't be here long," she predicted. "You don't want to talk?" "I don't want to talk about Maynard, no. I don't have any answers about anything that happened to him. Nobody does. But you can ask whatever you want. And you can take your leave when I get tired of you, or when you get bored with all the ways I can say 'I don't know'--whichever comes first." Encouraged, he reached for a tall-backed wooden chair and dragged it forward, putting his body directly into her line of sight. His notebook folded open to reveal an unlined sheet with a few small words scribbled at the top. While he was getting situated, she asked him, "Why do you want to know about Maynard? Why now? He's been dead for fifteen years. Nearly sixteen." "Why not now?" Hale scanned his previous page of notes, and settled down with his pencil hovering over the next blank section. "But to answer you more directly, I'm writing a book." "Another book?" she said, and it sounded sharp and fast. "Not a sensational piece," he was careful to clarify. "I want to write a proper biography of Maynard Wilkes, because I believe he's been done a great disservice. Don't you agree?" "No, I don't agree. He got exactly what he should have expected. He spent thirty years working hard, for nothing, and he was treateddisgracefully by the city he served." She fiddled with the half-smoked wand of tobacco. "He allowed it. And I hated him for it." "But your father believed in the law." She almost snapped at him. "So does every criminal." Hale perked. "Then you <i>do</i> think he was a criminal?" One more hard draw on the cigarette came and went, and then she said, "Don't twist my words. But you're right. He believed in the law. There were times I wasn't sure he believed in anything else, but yes. He believed in that." Spits and sparks from the fireplace filled the short silence that fell between them. Finally, Hale said, "I'm trying to get it right, ma'am. That's all. I think there was more to it than a jailbreak--" "Why?" she interrupted. "Why do you think he did it? Which theory do you want to write your book about, Mr. Quarter?" He hesitated, because he didn't know what to think, not yet. He gambled on the theory that he hoped Briar would find least offensive. "I think he was doing what he thought was right. But I really want to know what <i>you</i> think. Maynard raised you alone, didn't he? You must've known him better than anyone." Her face stayed a little too carefully blank. "You'd be surprised. We weren't that close." "But your mother died--" "When I was born, that's right. He was the only parent I ever had, and he wasn't much of one. He didn't know what to do with a daughter any more than I know what to do with a map of Spain." Hale sensed a brick wall, so he backed up and tried another way around, and into her good graces. His eyes scanned the smallish room with its solid and unadorned furniture, and its clean but battered floors. He noted the corridor that led to the back side of the house. And from his seat, he could see that all four doors at the end of it were closed. "You grew up here, didn't you? In this house?" he pretended to guess. She didn't soften. "Everybody knows that." "They brought him back here, though. One of the boys from the prison break, and his brother--they brought him here and tried to save him. A doctor was sent for, but ..." Briar retrieved the dangled thread of conversation and pulled it. "But he'd inhaled too much of the Blight. He was dead before the doctor ever got the message, and I swear"--she flicked a fingertip's worth of ash into the fire--"it's just as well. Can you imagine what would've happened to him, if he'd lived? Tried for treason, or gross insubordination at least. Jailed, at the minimum. Shot, at the worst. My father and I had our disagreements, but I wouldn't have wished that upon him. It's just as well," she said again, and she stared into the fire. Hale spent a few seconds trying to assemble a response. At last he said, "Did you get to see him, before he died? I know you were one of the last to leave Seattle--and I know you came here. Did you see him, one last time?" "I saw him." She nodded. "He was lying alone in that back room, on his bed, under a sheet that was soaked with the vomit that finally choked him to death. The doctor wasn't here, and as far as I know, he never did come. I don't know if you could even find one, in those days, in the middle of the evacuation." "So, he was alone? Dead, in this house?" "He was alone," she confirmed. "The front door was broken, but closed. Someone had left him on the bed, laid out with respect, I do remember that. Someone had covered him with a sheet, and left his rifle on the bed beside him with his badge. But he was dead, and he stayed dead. The Blight didn't start him walking again, so thank God for small things, I suppose." Hale jotted it all down, mumbling encouraging sounds as his pencil skipped across the paper. "Do you think the prisoners did that?" " <i>You</i> do," she said. It wasn't quite an accusation. "I suspect as much," he replied, but he was giddily certain of it. The prison-boy's brother had told him they'd left Maynard's place clean, and they didn't take a thing. He'd said they'd laid him out onthe bed, his face covered up. These were details that no one else had ever mentioned, not in all the speculation or investigation into the Great Blight Jailbreak. And there had been plenty of it over the years. "And then ...," he tried to prompt her. "I dragged him out back and buried him under the tree, beside his old dog. A couple days later, two city officers came out and dug him back up again." "To make sure?" She grunted. "To make sure he hadn't skipped town and gone back east; to make sure the Blight hadn't started him moving again; to make sure I'd put him where I said I did. Take your pick." He finished chasing her words with his pencil and raised his eyes. "What you just said, about the Blight. Did they know, so soon, about what it could do?" "They knew. They figured it out real quick. Not all the Blight-dead started moving, but the ones who <i>did</i> climbed up and went prowling pretty fast, within a few days. But mostly, people wanted to make sure Maynard hadn't gotten away with anything. And when they were satisfied that he was out of their reach, they dumped him back here. They didn't even bury him again. They just left him out there by the tree. I had to put him in the ground twice." Hale's pencil and his chin hung over the paper. "I'm sorry, did you say--do you mean ...?" "Don't look so shocked." She shifted in the chair and the leather tugged squeakily at her skin. "At least they didn't fill in the hole, the first time. The second time was a lot faster. Let me ask <i>you</i> a question, Mr. Quarter." "Hale, please." "Hale, as you like. Tell me, how old were you when the Blight came calling?" His pencil was shuddering, so he placed it flat against the notebook and answered her. "I was almost six." "That's about what I figured. So you were a little thing, then. You don't even remember it, do you--what it was like before the wall?" He turned his head back and forth; no, he didn't. Not really. "But I remember the wall, when it first went up. I remember watching it rise, foot by foot, around the contaminated blocks. All two hundred feet of it, all the way around the evacuated neighborhoods." "I remember it, too. I watched it from here. You could see it from that back window, by the kitchen." She waved her hand toward the stove, and a small rectangular portal behind it. "All day and all night for seven months, two weeks, and three days they worked to build that wall." "That's very precise. Do you always keep count of such things?" "No," she said. "But it's easy to remember. They finished construction on the day my son was born. I used to wonder if he didn't miss it, all the noise from the workers. It was all he ever heard, while I was carrying him--the swinging of the hammers, the pounding of the masons' chisels. As soon as the poor child arrived, the world fell silent." Something occurred to her, and she sat up straight. The chair hissed. She glanced at the door. "Speaking of the boy, it's getting late. Where's he gotten off to, I wonder? He's usually home by now." She corrected herself. "He's <i>often</i> home by now, and it's damnably cold out there." Hale settled against the stiff wood back of his borrowed seat. "It's a shame he never got to meet his grandfather. I'm sure Maynard would've been proud." Briar leaned forward, her elbows on her knees. She put her face in her hands and rubbed her eyes. "I don't know," she said. She straightened herself and wiped her forehead with the back of her arm. She peeled off her gloves and dropped them onto the squat, round table between the chair and the fireplace. "You don't know? But there aren't any other grandchildren, are there? He had no other children, did he?" "Not as far as I know, but I guess there's no telling." She leaned forward and began to unlace her boots. "I hope you'll excuse me," she said. "I've been wearing these since six o'clock this morning." "No, no, don't mind me," he said, and kept his eyes on the fire. "I'm sorry. I know I'm intruding." "You <i>are</i> intruding, but I let you in, so the fault is mine." One boot came free of her foot with a sucking pop. She went to work on the other one. "And I don't know if Maynard would've cared much for Zeke, or vice versa. They're not the same kind." "Is Zeke ..." Hale was tiptoeing toward dangerous ground, and he knew it, but he couldn't stop himself. "Too much like his father, perhaps?" Briar didn't flinch, or frown. Again she kept that poker-flat stare firmly in place as she removed the other boot and set it down beside the first one. "It's possible. Blood may tell, but he's still just a boy. There's time yet for him to sort himself out. But as for you, Mr. Hale, I'm afraid I'm going to have to see you on your way. It's getting late, and dawn comes before long." Hale sighed and nodded. He'd pushed too hard, and too far. He should've stayed on topic, on the dead father--not the dead husband. "I'm sorry," he told her as he rose and stuffed his notebook under his arm. He replaced his hat, pulled his coat tightly across his chest, and said, "And I thank you for your time. I appreciate everything you've told me, and if my book is ever published, I'll make note of your help." "Sure," she said. She closed Hale out, and into the night. He braced himself to face the windy winter evening, tugging his scarf tighter around his neck and adjusting his wool gloves.

The bartender says&nbsp;...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In this New Essential Guide to Alien Species, we cover the species that make the watering holes of scum and villainy come to life in that great &#x201c;galaxy far, far away.&#x201d; We also give you in-depth dossiers of the many alien players that populate George Lucas&#x2019;s ever-expanding universe. Whether they were invented by the designers of the ILM Monster Shop, the novelists, comic-book writers and illustrators, or game developers, this book provides you with the details on the most pivotal species in the Star Wars galaxy.<br> &nbsp;<br> The species in this book were selected because they met one or more of the following criteria: they appeared in at least one of the films, they were important to a major story line, or they were members of a species that begged for further exploration. While we&#x2019;ve done our best to select as many as possible of the species fans would like to see, as a second edition there are many that were not included that may have been in the first edition. As with all of the Essential Guides, the goal was to provide a valuable and representative overview of the vastness of the Star Wars universe, taking into account all the favorites and introducing you to a few new faces you may not have met before.<br> &nbsp;<br> While our perceptions of a given species are often based on only a few of its members, the truth is not all members of a given species are truly identical&#x2014;even the clones and animals. Among creatures and persons, there is a great deal of variety in values, traditions, and appearance. So while each entry herein may note the shared characteristics exhibited by a given species, there will come events that lead any individual from that group to &#x201c;break the rules.&#x201d; As our inspiration Senior Anthropologist Hoole once said, &#x201c;In this galaxy, when you&#x2019;ve seen one, don&#x2019;t assume you&#x2019;ve seen them all.&#x201d; Words to the wise as you set off on your journey to meet the players in this colorful, sometimes frightening, but always thrilling galaxy of our dreams.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the course of your own visits to the cantinas, spaceports, and gambling clubs of the Galaxy Far, Far Away, may the Force be with you, and with all creatures great, small, wild, and wonderful.<br> &nbsp;<br> ABOUT THE ENTRIES<br> In our last edition, Senior Anthropologist Hoole provided much of the observational material for the species he studied. Following the good senior anthropologist&#x2019;s recent retirement, he left his notes and volumes of research materials for us to use for this new guide. These detailed texts, along with our own observational notes, have helped us put together our entries and provide the following information. Please note that survey teams have not been able to reach all the worlds affected by the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, so the status of some species in the wake of that event has not yet been determined. If the present status of a species is known, it will be given in the body of the entry.<br> &nbsp;<br> DESIGNATION<br> Each species is designated as sentient, semi-sentient, or nonsentient. Usually this is based on a species&#x2019; ability to reason, use tools, and communicate. A panel of multicultural scientists determines the designations only after a government-approved research team has conducted a field study or has made some significant finding regarding the sentience of any given species. The designations are defined as follows:<br> &nbsp;<br> Sentient: When a species is given the sentient designation, it is considered able to reason and understand abstract concepts and ideas, make and use tools, and communicate with written or spoken language. Most primitive tribal species have this designation; it does not imply that a species is civilized to the point of space travel.<br> &nbsp;<br> Semi-sentient: The semi-sentient designation implies that a race has some reasoning ability, but cannot grasp elevated or abstract concepts. In many cases, it has not yet formed a written or spoken language. These species are considered to be in evolutionary stages&#x2014;on their way to achieving sentience. Under the Empire, these species were not entitled to landownership, but this has been undergoing reconsideration in the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nonsentient: A nonsentient species is one that does not reason at all, surviving only on its natural instincts.<br> &nbsp;<br> HOMEWORLD<br> Most alien species have a homeworld or system. Some, like the bantha, are found in many systems, and still others, such as the Hutts, have transplanted themselves to a new home. The primary locations of a given species within the galaxy will be listed here, and its present home will be likewise indicated.<br> &nbsp;<br> AVERAGE HEIGHT<br> The average size of adult members of a given species is provided in meters.<br> &nbsp;<br> PRONUNCIATION<br> The pronunciation of the species&#x2019; name is provided in Basic. For the pronunciation key, please see this page.<br> &nbsp;<br> NOTABLE APPEARANCE<br> We provide one of the noteworthy appearances of each species in book, film, or comics.<br> &nbsp;<br> GLOSSARY OF DESCRIPTIVE TERMS<br> The following terms are used to describe the species in this book. Many of the varieties covered in this volume belong to one or more of these classifications. Given the unique evolutionary conditions found on each planet, it is impossible to fit every species into a neat classification. These are broad terms useful in describing an unfamiliar species to one&#x2019;s colleagues.<br> &nbsp;<br> Amphibious: A creature that can live both in water and on land, or has two stages of life, one that is completely water-based, the other land-based. Some are born as tadpoles possessing gills, and develop lungs to breathe air, while others have compound lungs that allow them to breathe underwater and on land.<br> &nbsp;<br> Arboreal: A species that lives among forests and trees, and is specially adapted to tree living.<br> &nbsp;<br> Avian: A species bearing the characteristics of birds or flying mammals.<br> &nbsp;<br> Canine: A species that possesses some characteristics of the dog family, including a pronounced muzzle, sharp teeth, advanced hunting and tracking instincts, heightened hearing, sight, and smell, sharp teeth, claws, padded feet, and a tail.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cephalopod: A species that bears the traits inherent in most squid and octopi, namely water-based or amphibious creatures with tentacles.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cetacean: Any species of aquatic or marine mammals, usually typified by a predominance of the following: a hairless or nearly hairless body, anterior flipper-like limbs, vestigial posterior limbs, and a flat, notched tail.<br> &nbsp;<br> Crustacean: Aquatic lobster-like arthropods or shellfish that usually have a segmented body, a chitinous exoskeleton, and paired, jointed limbs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cyborg: Any species that has been enhanced with technological implants.<br> &nbsp;<br> Feline: A species that carries some characteristics of the cat family, such as extremely flexible body, sharp teeth, slit-pupiled eyes, a tail, hunting and tracking instincts, heightened hearing, sight, and smell, and padded, clawed hands and feet.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gastropod: A species that has no true skeletal frame and moves by means of a wide muscular foot, or whose whole body acts as one large foot.<br> &nbsp;<br> Humanoid: Those species that, while not related genetically to humans, possess characteristics similar to humans, such as two arms with hands, fingers, and an opposable thumb, two legs, a torso, and a single head.<br> &nbsp;<br> Insectoid: Any species that has the characteristics of insects, which may include a chitinous shell, multiple legs, antennae, and multifaceted eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mammal: This classification usually refers to warm-blooded vertebrates that grow fur and usually bear live young (although not always, as some have been known to lay eggs). Regardless of the birth process, a female mammal nurses her young.<br> &nbsp;<br> Near-human: These species are genetically related to humans, and are usually classified as humans. Only four near-human species are represented in this book.<br> &nbsp;<br> Pachydermoid: A species with characteristics attributed to pachyderms, usually including baggy, leathery skin, a trunk, and steady, thick legs and feet.<br> &nbsp;<br> Plant-based: A species that reproduces itself and roots like most plant life, usually feeding through photosynthesis. Some plant-based species resemble animal species, depending on evolution.<br> &nbsp;<br> Porcine: A species bearing the characteristic of a pig, sometimes including a blunt-ended nose, tusks, hooves, and large physical size.<br> &nbsp;<br> Primate: Mammalian species exhibiting the characteristics of monkeys or apes, including fur, fingers, and opposable thumbs. They are often referred to as humanoids because of their similarity to human physiology, but this depends on their sentience designation.<br> &nbsp;<br> Proboscidian: A species that has a long trunk or feeds through a proboscis, such as the Anzati. Some proboscidians are also pachydermoids (see Pachydermoid).<br> &nbsp;<br> Reptavian: A flying reptile.<br> &nbsp;<br> Reptilian: A species with the characteristics of a reptile or snake, usually including leather-like skin, claws, slit-pupiled eyes, and a forked tongue. They reproduce by laying fertilized eggs. Some can change color to match their environment. Trandoshans, Barabels, Yevetha, and Falleen are all reptilian races.<br> &nbsp;<br> Reptomammal: A reptile that reproduces through live birth rather than laying eggs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rodent: A species that carries characteristics of mice or rats, or gnawing or nibbling mammals that have continuously growing incisors.<br> &nbsp;<br> Saurian: See Reptilian.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ungulate: A species that has hooves, or whose claws evolved from hooves, and sometimes chews its cud.<br> &nbsp;<br> Vacuumbreather: A species that can survive in a vacuum, including that of outer space, often consuming nutrients from space dust and mineral matter. Mynocks are vacuumbreathers.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Freedom for the Thought That We Hate: A Biography of the First Amendment</h2><p><b>From one of the most influential journalists of the last half century, an essential explanation and defense of a foundational American idea: free speech</b><br>More than any other people on earth, we Americans are free to say and write what we think. The press can air the secrets of government, the corporate boardroom, or the bedroom with little fear of punishment or penalty. This extraordinary freedom results not from America's culture of tolerance, but from fourteen words in the constitution: the free expression clauses of the First Amendment.<br>In <i>Freedom for the Thought That We Hate</i>, two-time Pulitzer Prize-winner Anthony Lewis describes how our free-speech rights were created in five distinct areas: political speech, artistic expression, libel, commercial speech, and unusual forms of expression such as T-shirts and campaign spending. It is a story of hard choices, heroic judges, and the fascinating and eccentric defendants who forced the legal system to come face to face with one of America's great founding ideas.</p><p><b>Anthony Lewis</b> (1927-2013), a two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize, was a columnist for the <i>New York Times</i> op-ed page from 1969 through 2001. In addition to his long and distinguished career with the Times, Mr. Lewis was, starting in 1983, the James Madison Visiting Professor at Columbia University. He was the author of two other books, <i>Gideon's Trumpet</i> and <i>Make No Law</i>."[A] heroic account of how courageous judges in the 20th century created the modern First Amendment."&#x2015;<b>Jeffrey Rosen</b>, <b><i><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b></i></b><br><br>Mr. Lewis does a remarkable job of presenting the history and scope of freedom of thought...a concise and wise book."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Economist</b></i></i></b><br><br>"[Lewis] looks behind the printed page to scrutinize the experiences and values of the men and women whose utterances are given the force of law. The result is a short history of the First Amendment that is always illuminating and sometimes rollicking."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Los Angeles Times</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Lewis blends a profound understanding of First Amendment jurisprudence and history with an enjoyable writing style that his readers have long come to admire. In our war-torn era where dissent and open-minded debate have become problematic, Lewis compels us to remember the crucial function free speech serves in our democratic form of government."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Christian Science Monitor</i></b></i></b><br><br>"It's hard to imagine a book about legal history reading like a page-turner, but this one does. The Supreme Court justices whose decisions have shaped our country emerge as conflicted and principled human beings. The questions that have yet to be settled press impatiently against the book's pages, reminding us that the First Amendment continues to shift under our feet even as we read."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Providence Journal</i></b></i></b></p><h2>Mourning Diary</h2><p><p>"In the sentence &#x2018;She's no longer suffering,' to what, to whom does &#x2018;she' refer? What does that present tense mean?" &#x2015;Roland Barthes, from his diary</p><p>The day after his mother's death in October 1977, Roland Barthes began a diary of mourning. For nearly two years, the legendary French theorist wrote about a solitude new to him; about the ebb and flow of sadness; about the slow pace of mourning, and life reclaimed through writing. Named a Top 10 Book of 2010 by <i>The New York Times</i> and one of the Best Books of 2010 by <i>Slate</i> and <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>, <i>Mourning Diary</i> is a major discovery in Roland Barthes's work: a skeleton key to the themes he tackled throughout his life, as well as a unique study of grief&#x2015;intimate, deeply moving, and universal.</p></p><p><b>Roland Barthes </b>(1915-1980) was a French cultural and literary critic, whose clever and lyrical writings on semiotics made structuralism one of the leading movements of the twentieth century. Barthes had a cult following and published seventeen books, including <i>Camera Lucida</i>, <i>Mythologies</i>, and <i>A Lover's Discourse</i>.<b>MOURNING DIARY<br>October 26, 1977&#x2013;June 21, 1978<br></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 26, 1977<br></b>First wedding night.But first mourning night?&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 27<br></b>&#x2014;You have never known a Woman&#x2019;s body!&#x2014;I have known the body of my mother, sick and then dying.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 27<br></b>Every morning, around 6:30, in the darkness outside, the metallic racket of the garbage cans.She would say with relief: the night is finally over (she suffered during the night, alone, a cruel business).&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as someone dies, frenzied construction of the future (shifting furniture, etc.): futuromania.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 27</b><br>Who knows? Maybe something valuable in these notes?&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 27</b><br>&#x2014;SS: I&#x2019;ll take care of you, I&#x2019;ll prescribe some calm.&#x2014;RH: You&#x2019;ve been depressed for six months because you knew. Bereavement, depression, work, etc.&#x2014;But said discreetly, as always.Irritation. No, bereavement (depression) is different from sickness. What should I be cured of? To find what condition, what life? If someone is to be born, that person will not be blank, but a moral being, a subject of value&#x2014;not of integration.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 27<br></b>Immortality. I&#x2019;ve never understood that strange, Pyrrhonic position; I just don&#x2019;t know.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 27<br></b>Everyone guesses&#x2014;I feel this&#x2014;the degree of a bereavement&#x2019;s intensity. But it&#x2019;s impossible (meaningless, contradictory signs) to measure how much someone is afflicted.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 27</b><br>&#x2014;&#x201c;Never again, never again!&#x201d;&#x2014;And yet there&#x2019;s a contradiction: &#x201c;never again&#x201d; isn&#x2019;t eternal, since you yourself will die one day.&#x201c;Never again&#x201d; is the expression of an immortal.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 27</b><br>Overcrowded gathering. Inevitable, increasing futility. I think of her, in the next room. Everything collapses.It is, here, the formal beginning of the big, long bereavement.For the first time in two days, the acceptable notion of my own death.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 28<br></b>Bringing maman&#x2019;s body from Paris to Urt (with JL and the undertaker): stopping for lunch in a tiny trucker&#x2019;s dive, at Sorigny (after Tours). The undertaker meets a &#x201c;colleague&#x201d; there (taking a body to Haute-Vienne) and joins him for lunch. I walk a few steps with Jean-Louis on one side of the square (with its hideous monument to the dead), bare ground, the smell of rain, the sticks. And yet, something like a savor of life (because of the sweet smell of the rain), the very first discharge, like a momentary palpitation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 29<br></b>How strange: her voice, which I knew so well, and which is said to be the very texture of memory (&#x201c;the dear inflection . . .&#x201d;), I no longer hear.

What does that present tense mean?&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 29<br></b>A stupefying, though not distressing notion&#x2014;that she has not been &#x201c;everything&#x201d; for me. If she had, I wouldn&#x2019;t have written my work. Since I&#x2019;ve been taking care of her, the last six months in fact, she was &#x201c;everything&#x201d; for me, and I&#x2019;ve completely forgotten that I&#x2019;d written. I was no longer anything but desperately hers. Before, she had made herself transparent so that I could write.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 29<br></b>In taking these notes, I&#x2019;m trusting myself to the banality that is in me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 29</b><br>The desires I had before her death (while she was sick) can no longer be fulfilled, for that would mean it is her death that allows me to fulfill them&#x2014;her death might be a liberation in some sense with regard to my desires. But her death has changed me, I no longer desire what I used to desire. I must wait&#x2014;supposing that such a thing could happen&#x2014;for a new desire to form, a desire following her death.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 29<br></b>The measurement of mourning.(Dictionary, Memorandum): eighteen months for mourning a father, a mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 30</b><br>At Urt: sad, gentle, deep (relaxed).&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 30<br></b>. . . that this death fails to destroy me altogether means that I want to live wildly, madly, and that therefore the fear of my own death is always there, not displaced by a single inch.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 30</b><br>Many others still love me, but from now on my death would kill no one.&#x2014;which is what&#x2019;s new.(But Michel?)&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 31</b><br>I don&#x2019;t want to talk about it, for fear of making literature out of it&#x2014;or without being sure of not doing so&#x2014;although as a matter of fact literature originates within these truths.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 31<br></b>Monday, 3:00 p.m.&#x2014;Back alone for the first time in the apartment.

I experience this as a sickness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 31</b><br>Sometimes, very briefly, a blank moment&#x2014;a kind of numbness&#x2014;which is not a moment of forgetfulness.

The expression I used when I brought maman something, when I was taking care of her. Once, toward the end, half-conscious, she repeated, faintly, Voil� (I&#x2019;m here, a word we used to each other all our lives).The word spoken by the girl at the bakery brought tears to my eyes. I kept on crying quite a while back in the silent apartment.That&#x2019;s how I can grasp my mourning.Not directly in solitude, empirically, etc.; I seem to have a kind of ease, of control that makes people think I&#x2019;m suffering less ...</p><h2>An Impartial Witness: A Bess Crawford Mystery (Bess Crawford Mysteries, 2)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Todd&#x2019;s novels are known for compelling plotting with a thoughtful whodunit aspect, rich characterization, evocative prose, and haunting atmosphere.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<em>Richmond Times-Dispatch</em></p><p>&#x201c;Readers who can&#x2019;t get enough of [Jacqueline Winspear&#x2019;s] Maisie Dobbs...are bound to be caught up in the adventures of Bess Crawford.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<em>New York Times Book Review</em></p><p>To great critical acclaim, author Charles Todd introduced protagonist Bess Crawford in <em>A Duty to the Dead</em>.

But later, in a crowded railway station, Bess sees the same woman bidding a heart-wrenching farewell to a departing officer, clearly not her husband. </p><p>Back on duty in France, Bess is shocked to discover the wife&#x2019;s photograph in a newspaper accompanying a plea from Scotland Yard for information about her murder, which took place on the very day Bess witnessed that anguished farewell. Granted leave to speak with the authorities, Bess very quickly finds herself entangled in a case of secrets and deadly betrayal in which another life hangs in the balance, and her search for the truth could expose her to far graver dangers than those she faces on the battlefield.</p><p>Charles Todd is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of the Inspector Ian Rutledge mysteries, the Bess Crawford mysteries, and two stand-alone novels. Among the honors accorded to the Ian Rutledge mysteries are the Barry Award and nominations for the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association&#x2019;s Dilys Award, the Edgar and Anthony Awards in the U.S., and the John Creasey Award in the UK.

We are the center around which the vast threads and everyday minutiae of our life spins. Aries Rodney King asked, "Why can't we all just get along?" The honest question is, "Why can't you guys all get along with me?" Forget feel-good astrology and take a trip to the maladjusted side of the Universe. Outwardly, each of us may profess to live for others. Secretly, we all want what we want, right now.<br><br>Everyone is mad here, just as the Cheshire Cat said; and egotistical, obsessed, controlling, and moody. Knowing how each sign manifests those disagreeable qualities and learning how to control, aim, and fire the force of your own wicked twin within are the keys to staying ahead of that pack of monsters snapping at your heels.<br><br><b><i>The Basics</i></b><br><br>In astrology, there are four elements (Fire, Earth, Air, and Water), three qualities (Cardinal, Fixed, and Mutable), and two polarities (Masculine and Feminine).<br><br><b>FIRE</b> signs are <i>selfish.</i> Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius are egotistical and demanding. This holier-than-thou bunch thinks the sun rises and sets on them. They attempt to control the rest of the world by force, intimidation, and temper tantrums. These human volcanoes erupt on a regular basis.<br><br><b>EARTH</b> signs are <i>hardheaded.</i> Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn are calculating, critical, and callous. They are preoccupied with work and penny-pinching and they point out everyone else's faults. Boring and churlish, they subscribe to the do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do philosophy of control. They dole out their affections as carefully as their money.<br><br><b>AIR</b> signs are <i>flighty.</i> Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius are fickle, glib, and long-winded. They change lovers, jobs, and their minds as often as the rest of us change underwear. And with just as little thought. Rationalization and justification are Air's tools of control. They want us to think they are logical. In reality we usually give in just to shut them up.<br><br><b>WATER</b> signs are <i>moody.</i> Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces are the drama kings and queens. Self-destructive and manipulative, this awful bunch tries to control the rest of us through emotional blackmail. Water seeks not only its lowest level but yours as well. These characters will stop at nothing to find your weak spot and pick at it until you crack.<br><br>As for the qualities and polarities, the following comparisons will give you enough to get started.<br><br>Traditional astrology defines <b>Cardinal</b> as the initiator and leader. Rotten-truth translation: a bossy, pot-stirring meddler. Aries, Cancer, Capricorn, and Libra are the Cardinal signs. The <b>Fixed</b> quality is defined as stable and persistent. Translation: a stubborn, exasperating bore. The Fixed signs are Aquarius, Leo, Scorpio, and Taurus. <b>Mutable</b> signs are described as flexible and adaptable. Translation: an inconsistent, self-delusional escapist. Gemini, Sagittarius, Pisces, and Virgo are the Mutable signs.<br><br>Finally, each sign is assigned a <b>Masculine</b> (outgoing) or <b>Feminine</b> (receptive) polarity. The rotten truth about this facet of the sun-sign personality is that masculine is an aggressor and feminine is an emotional manipulator.<br><br>Use the following tables as quick guides to the basic nature of each sign.<br><br><b>Traditional</b><br><br><b>Sign Element Quality Polarity</b><br><br>Aries Fire Cardinal Masculine<br><br>Taurus Earth Fixed Feminine<br><br>Gemini Air Mutable Masculine<br><br>Cancer Water Cardinal Feminine<br><br>Leo Fire Fixed Masculine<br><br>Virgo Earth Mutable Feminine<br><br>Libra Air Cardinal Masculine<br><br>Scorpio Water Fixed Feminine<br><br>Sagittarius Fire Mutable Masculine<br><br>Capricorn Earth Cardinal Feminine<br><br>Aquarius Air Fixed Masculine<br><br>Pisces Water Mutable Feminine<br><br><b>Rotten Truth</b><br><br><b>Sign Element Quality Polarity</b><br><br>Aries Selfish Bossy Aggressive<br><br>Taurus Hardheaded Stubborn Emotional Manipulator<br><br>Gemini Flighty Inconsistent Aggressive<br><br>Cancer Moody Bossy Emotional Manipulator<br><br>Leo Selfish Stubborn Aggressive<br><br>Virgo Hardheaded Inconsistent Emotional Manipulator<br><br>Libra Flighty Bossy Aggressive<br><br>Scorpio Moody Stubborn Emotional Manipulator<br><br>Sagittarius Selfish Inconsistent Aggressive<br><br>Capricorn Hardheaded Bossy Emotional Manipulator<br><br>Aquarius Flighty Stubborn Aggressive<br><br>Pisces Moody Inconsistent Emotional Manipulator<br><br>How does it work? Let's look at Aquarius. How can a person be flighty, stubborn, and aggressive? Water Bearers can change horses midstream. Question their decision, and you'll suffer a tiresome, in-your-face dissertation aimed at forcing your agreement. That's aggressive. They can have twenty lovers in a year. That's flighty. The fact that they are determined to keep going until they find true love and dumb enough to think it exists -- that's stubborn.<br><br><b><i>Down the Rabbit-Hole</i></b><br><br>Now that you have the basics, it's time to take an in-depth look at the sun signs.

He leaps through the fields until he reaches the farmhouse, where he sees a small light in the window. Inside, a boy is saying his prayers, and he offers up a special prayer for the corn that will be harvested in the morning. Humbled, the scarecrow knows what he has to do: He returns to the field and watches over the corn as only he can. Masterfully told, with illustrations by award winner Bagram Ibatoulline, this book has all the makings of a new classic.</p><p>Jane Yolen is an award-winning author who has written more than 380 books for children, including the bestseller&nbsp;<i>How Do Dinosaurs Say Good Night?</i>&nbsp;and the 1988 Caldecott Medal winner&nbsp;<i>Owl Moon</i>. She is known for her beautiful poetry, picture books, fairy tales,&nbsp;novels, and nonfiction, and has even been called &#x201c;the Hans Christian Andersen of America&#x201d; (<i>Newsweek</i>). She lives in Hatfield, Massachusetts. Visit her at JaneYolen.com.<br><br>Bagram Ibatoulline was born in Russia and educated at the Moscow State Academic Art Institute. His first book was Philip Booth's <i>Crossing</i>, named a 2001 Best Book by <i>Publishers Weekly</i>.&nbsp;He is best known for his books with Kate di Camillo, <i>The Miraculous Journey of&nbsp;Edward Tulane</i>, and <i>Great Joy</i>.&nbsp; &nbsp;Bagram lives in Gouldsboro, Pennsylvania.PreSchool-Grade 1&#x2013;Despite the pairing of formidable talents, this book will likely have a limited audience. The purposeful plot is driven by its message: a scarecrow that experiences the freedom of a wind-blown night decides to return to his post (literally) after witnessing the farm boy on his knees, praying for the straw man's success in guarding the crops. There is little action, except for the protagonist breezing along past a dimly lit tractor, weathered barn, and cows at rest. Each of Ibatoulline's gouache and watercolor scenes is technically brilliant and atmospheric, but there is a disconnect with the sequencing and passage of time. Opening pages depict the corn silhouetted against a sky that is pink at the horizon and hazy blue on the upper borders of the spreads (twilight?). Subsequent spreads are a mixture of deeper blues, then a return to pink light, a misty gray, rose again, and finally almost turquoise; the effect is disconcerting. The sentimentality climaxes when the scarecrow peers through the darkness into the boy's bedroom, which is drenched in an orange glow. Yolen's unremarkable poetry reads: The scarecrow heard/With painted ears,/And wept a pail/Of painted tears. Adults may find this story of faith and duty uplifting, but kids will prefer the nocturnal farm adventures found in Bill Martin and John Archambault's <i>Barn Dance!</i> (Holt, 1986).<i>&#x2013;Wendy Lukehart, Washington DC Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When the lovers choose to die by their own hands, their three orphaned children are taken in chains to Rome; only two&#x2014;the ten-year-old twins Selene and Alexander&#x2014;survive the journey. Delivered to the household of Octavian&#x2019;s sister, the siblings cling to each other and to the hope that they will return one day to their rightful place on the throne of Egypt.<br><br> Recounted in Selene&#x2019;s youthful and engaging voice, Moran introduces a compelling cast of historical characters: Octavia, the emperor Octavian&#x2019;s kind and compassionate sister, abandoned by Marc Antony for Cleopatra; Livia, Octavian's bitter and jealous wife; Marcellus, Octavian&#x2019;s handsome, flirtatious nephew and heir apparent; Tiberius, Livia&#x2019;s sardonic son and Marcellus&#x2019;s great rival for power; and Juba, Octavian&#x2019;s watchful aide, whose honored position at court has far-reaching effects on the lives of the young Egyptian royals. <br><br>Selene&#x2019;s narrative is animated by the concerns of a young girl in any time and place&#x2014;the possibility of finding love, the pull of friendship and family, and the pursuit of her unique interests and talents. And as Selene and Alexander come of age, they are buffeted by the personal ambitions of Octavian&#x2019;s family and court, by the ever-present threat of slave rebellion, and by the longings and desires deep within their own hearts.<br><br>Based on meticulous research, <i>Cleopatra&#x2019;s Daughter </i>is a fascinating portrait of imperial Rome and of the people and events of this glorious and most volatile period in human history. Emerging from the shadows of the past, Selene, a young woman of irresistible charm and preternatural intelligence, will capture your heart.</p><p><b>MICHELLE MORAN&#x2019;s</b>&nbsp;experiences at archaeological sites around the world motivated her to write historical fiction and continue to provide inspiration for her novels. She is nationally bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>Nefertiti</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Heretic Queen</i>,&nbsp;<i>Cleopatra's Daughter</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Madame Tussaud</i>. Visit her online at michellemoran.com.Moran's latest foray into the world of classical history (after <i>The Heretic Queen</i>) centers upon the children of Marc Antony and Cleopatra . After the death of their parents, twins Alexander and Selene and younger brother Ptolemy are in a dangerous position, left to the mercy of their father's greatest rival, Octavian Caesar. However, Caesar does not kill them as expected, but takes the trio to Rome to be paraded as part of his triumphant return and to demonstrate his solidified power. As the twins adapt to life in Rome in the inner circle of Caesar's family, they grow into adulthood ensconced in a web of secrecy, intrigue and constant danger. Told from Selene's perspective, the tale draws readers into the fascinating world of ancient Rome and into the court of Rome's first and most famous emperor. Deftly encompassing enough political history to provide context, Moran never clutters her narrative with extraneous facts. Readers may be frustrated that Selene is more observer than actor, despite the action taking place around her, but historical fiction enthusiasts will delight in this solid installment from a talented name in the genre. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

"Does that mean you're out?"<br><br>"No, Clare. That's another kind of ball game."<br><br>"I hope you're talking about the Yankees."<br><br>"What do you think?"<br><br>"I think you should give up pitching woo and pitch in behind this counter . . ."<br><br>We were short-staffed this evening with every caf&#x17d; table occupied, the coffee bar packed, and a line of customers spilling into the chilly West Village night. Couples who couldn't find seats were sipping their lattes on the cold sidewalk.<br><br>According to my young baristas, the reason for this bounty of business was a hot new "dating game" application for smartphones. Hot was the operative word, since the app was called Cinder. This one included "user ratings" for the best public meeting places in the city, and we currently ranked in the top three.<br><br>Now that our landmark coffeehouse was a hookup hot spot for digital dating, my quiet evenings at the Village Blend displayed all the tranquility of a Times Square crosswalk.<br><br>"I'll work a shift," Matt told me. "But I'm not aproning-up until you caffeinate me."<br><br>"You want a single?" I asked.<br><br>"Make it a Red Eye."<br><br>The Red Eye aka "Shot in the Dark" was the barista's answer to the bartender's boilermaker, a jolty combination of espresso poured into a cup of high-caffeine light roast. It wasn't for the faint of heart. But then neither was my ex-husband.<br><br>A legend in the trade, Matteo Allegro was among the most talented coffee hunters in the world, as comfortable on a yacht floating in Portofino as in a muddy Jeep flirting with the edge of the Andes on Bolivia's infamous Death Road.<br><br>Adrenaline wasn't his only drug. During our marriage, he became addicted to cocaine while partying too hard below the equator. I helped him kick that deadly habit but failed to dent his other addiction-women.<br><br>Matt generated enough heat around the world's coffee belt to increase global warming, which is why I made the mature decision to put our marriage on ice. Even so, his behavior tonight seemed excessive. Who makes three dates in one night? And how could Matt have possibly struck out on all of them?<br><br>The very idea was (I had to admit) amusing. Not that anyone's rejection deserved to be mocked. On the contrary, I did my level best to suppress the surging wisecracks.<br><br>My raven-haired barista Esther, on the other hand, did not share my overactive conscience. From her perch at the register, she propped a hand on her ample hip and targeted Matt through her black-framed glasses.<br><br>"Did I hear right?" she asked. "The prince of passion was passed over? The sultan of seduction shunned? The archduke of desire dumped?"<br><br>"Hard to believe, I know . . ." With a smirk, Matt pushed his sweater's sleeves up tanned and sculpted forearms. "But even the best swingers foul out from time to time."<br><br>"I saw your first two dates vacate your table," Esther said. "I lost track of the third. What was the reason for the last heave-ho? She's a vegan and you eat veal?"<br><br>"No. The vegan was Mindy, an hour ago."<br><br>"What about the redhead at eight thirty?"<br><br>"She said I reminded her of her ex."<br><br>"And the little blonde who just left? Why didn't she like you?"<br><br>"Actually, she did. I reminded her of her father."<br><br>"Ouch."<br><br>I tried not to laugh-and failed.<br><br>Matt noticed. "You're enjoying this, aren't you?"<br><br>"I'm sorry," I said. Hoping to make it up to him, I slid over his Red Eye. "Here you go, made with love."<br><br>Matt took a long hit and sighed. Then he laid his rosebud on the counter like a carnation on a coffin-and picked his smartphone back up.<br><br>"Hey! You agreed to help us back here, remember?"<br><br>Matt's focus didn't falter. "Just one more check of my Pumpkin Pot."<br><br>"Your what?"<br><br>Esther rolled her eyes. "He's talking about that stupid Cinder app."<br><br>With a deep breath for patience, I went back to work behind the espresso machine. Three cappuccinos and two hazelnut mochas later, the man was still swiping.<br><br>"Enough!" I grabbed the phone.<br><br>That got his attention. "What's with the hostility?"<br><br>"I'm not hostile!" A few heads turned, and I lowered my voice. "Okay, maybe I'm a little hostile. This swipe-to-select coupling, and all these amped-up matches-it's like romance on Red Eyes. In my view, love should not be a sport."<br><br>"Not a sport, Clare, a game . . ." Snatching back his phone, Matt waved me closer. "Check this out-"<br><br>Like a little boy with a new toy, he showed off the screen. The word Cinder crackled in red letters, tongues of flame licking the edges. Below the logo were colorful animations-a glass slipper, fluttering fairy, and pulsing pumpkin-floating as innocently as Disney props.<br><br>Matt's finger stroked the tiny pumpkin. It jiggled and bounced, then grew and grew. Fairy dust fell from the digital sky, and the pumpkin transformed into a royal carriage with a purple banner reading-<br><br>TODAY'S CINDER-ELLAS!<br><br>Thumbnail images of a dozen women flew out the carriage door and formed a grid pattern. Matt tapped one of them, and a profile opened, showing an attractive woman with a forced coquettish smile, bangs arranged over one eye with great determination.<br><br>"I just swiped this Ella into my Pumpkin Pot. If she swipes my profile right by midnight tomorrow, I'll get a Tinkerbell notification."<br><br>"A what?"<br><br>"It means she sent him a Glass Slipper, dear." The reply came not from Matt but from his mother-Madame Dreyfus Allegro Dubois.<br><br>The beloved octogenarian owner of this century-old family business was in fine form this evening, sporting tailored wool slacks and a cashmere sweater the color of textured latte milk. Her silk scarf, printed with Edgar Degas's Dancers in Violet, brought out that very hue in her eyes, which appeared livelier than usual in our shop's soft evening light.<br><br>As Matt greeted his mother with a kiss on both cheeks, I pulled her a fresh espresso. "What brings you here so late?"<br><br>"I have a rendezvous!"<br><br>"With Otto?" I assumed since she'd been seeing the gallery owner for some time. But she shook her head.<br><br>"Otto's consultation work in Europe is ongoing. He and I agreed to keep things loose. And you know I'll need an escort for your wedding-once you and your blue knight finally decide on a venue."<br><br>"Believe me, we're trying."<br><br>"So . . ." She waved her smartphone. "I'm swiping to meet!"<br><br>"You're using Cinder?"<br><br>"Don't be silly! I use the Silver Foxes dating app. That software allows either sex to make the first move."<br><br>Matt's eyebrow arched. "Maybe I should try it."<br><br>"Heavens no, it's not for children! The user age starts at sixty-five."<br><br>Esther snorted. "Hear that? In twenty short years, Mr. Boss will have a date."<br><br>Matt waved his phone. "More like twenty seconds."<br><br>Tinker-Tinker!<br><br>"See!" he said with renewed vigor-and thumb typing.<br><br>"What just happened?" I asked Esther.<br><br>"Cinder sent him a Tinkerbell notification."<br><br>"Of what? The approach of Captain Hook?"<br><br>"It's just a glorified text message," Esther explained, "telling him a woman wants to communicate with him. In Cinder-speak they call it a Glass Slipper. Only a Cinder-ella can send a slipper to a Cinder-fella. That's one reason the app has become so hot."<br><br>Matt nodded. "Contrary to the Connie Francis song, boys go where the girls are, and more women are on Cinder than any other app. They feel safer making the first move, and I'm happy to let them. Once they swipe me right, Tinkerbell alerts me, and we can set up a date to see if-"<br><br>"The Glass Slipper fits. I get it."<br><br>"And if it does . . ." Matt grinned. "We're on our way to the . . . uh-hem ball. That's Cinder-speak for going to-"<br><br>"I get that, too. But what happens if Ms. Pumpkin Pot swipes left on you instead of right?"<br><br>"Then we're done. Accept-Reject. Win-Lose. It's that simple."<br><br>"Simple? Or reductive? The decision to accept or reject a human being is being made on a few pictures and a paragraph!"<br><br>"So?" Matt halted his thumb-typing. "Look, it's no different than meeting a prospective partner in a bar or at a party. You check each other out, flirt a little, and you hit it off-or you don't. The app just makes the party bigger."<br><br>"One must keep up with the times, dear," Madame advised with a wink. Then she finished her espresso and tossed us a farewell wave. "My Silver Fox is in the coop!"<br><br>"I don't disagree with your mother," I told Matt when he finally joined us behind the counter. "Keeping up with change is smart-from a practical standpoint. But there are larger issues to consider."<br><br>"Like what?"<br><br>"Like change isn't always for the better, especially when it involves human nature."<br><br>Matt scoffed, but Esther countered-<br><br>"Ms. Boss ain't wrong. I read an article by a social scientist who believes these dating apps are artificially turbo-boosting the 'hit-it-and-quit-it' culture, devolving excessive users into the addictive cycle of Skinner box animals."<br><br>"See?"<br><br>Matt waved away my concern. As he tied on his apron, he pointed to his mother, who was already happily on her way out the door with her dapper-looking date. Then he challenged me to prove this "devolution" theory with a concrete example.<br><br>I couldn't. Not then. Within the hour, however, one of our customers did it for me . . .<br><br>I was sipping an espresso on a much-needed break when-<br><br>BANG!<br><br>The sound of a single gunshot tore through our upstairs lounge.<br><br>Looking back, I shouldn't have been so shocked. A new mate with every swipe meant the old one was tossed away. When it happens enough times, anyone's candy-store excitement could turn sour, even bitter. Binary code could connect continents, but it couldn't reprogram people, delete our fears and frailties. Or erase our potential for violence . . .<br><br>At the sound of that bang upstairs, everyone on the main floor quieted, the sea of faces going blanker than a dead smartphone screen.<br><br>Was that really a gun?<br><br>BANG! BANG! BANG!<br><br>With three more shots, chaos ensued. Freaked-out bodies stampeded the exit in unstoppable waves, and I bobbed amid the panic like a cork in the Atlantic.<br><br>"Clare!" Matt shouted, leaping over the counter. "Where are you?"<br><br>"I'm here!" I jumped up to show him and, on the next bounce, screamed a gentle suggestion to-<br><br>"Call the police!"<br><br>Two<br><br>As frantic patrons flowed around me, I noticed something disturbing (apart from the gunfire and mass exodus). Not a single person had come down from the second floor.<br><br>I pushed my way through the crowd until I'd reached the bottom of our spiral staircase. It stood like a wrought-iron sculpture, still and empty. Peering up, I saw no one and quickly climbed three steps for height.<br><br>Across the retreating sea of humanity, Matt was calling 911. When our eyes met, I pointed to the ceiling, my meaning clear-<br><br>I'm going up!<br><br>Matt's eyes bugged and he fervently shook his head.<br><br>I knew he wanted me to wait for the police, but I couldn't sit by and do nothing. One of my other baristas, Dante Silva, was up there, along with a floor of innocent customers.<br><br>Was this a hostage situation? Or someone's idea of a joke? Were people terrorized and injured? Or was this simply a misunderstanding?<br><br>Whatever was going down, I was determined to have a look, and (if possible) try to help. This was my coffeehouse, my staff, my responsibility.<br><br>"You take the service stairs!" I mouthed to Matt before starting my climb.<br><br>As I crested the top, I slowed my movements, entering the lounge in a crouched position. I spotted Dante's shaved head and tattooed arms in a small crowd of gawking patrons.<br><br>Finally, I saw who they were gawking at.<br><br>A slender woman stood near the middle of the room. She was about my daughter's age. Her white silk blouse looked virginal over her pink flowered skirt. Honey blond hair fell to her twenty-something shoulders.<br><br>I'd seen her several times in our coffeehouse. She seemed a shy type, always sat alone-though she sometimes conversed with Tucker Burton, my assistant manager. On those visits, her willowy arms had sported a fashionable handbag or tote. Tonight, those limbs appeared to be accessorized with a semiautomatic handgun.<br><br>"DON'T YOU EVER LAUGH AT ME AGAIN. GOT IT?!"<br><br>Her shrill threat was directed at a man in his thirties. Cornered and cowering in a high-back Victorian chair, the guy appeared to be dressing for success in a designer skinny suit and open-collared shirt. His brown hair was threaded with salon-golden highlights, and the cut looked trendy-close-cropped on the sides with the thick, longish top slicked back.<br><br>I'd seen this man a few times over the past week-in the company of several different women-though I couldn't be sure, since his hands were raised in front of him and his head was turned at an angle that effectively hid his face.<br><br>"I'll shoot you next time instead of the ceiling! How would you like that? A bullet right into your heart. Or maybe your smirking mouth. Or better yet, how about down there?"<br><br>Wisely, Mr. Bullseye elected not to take the multiple-choice quiz.<br><br>"Maybe I should shoot you down there. Then you'll know how painful it is to be shot down!"<br><br>Tinker-Tinker!<br><br>The man's smartphone had fallen onto the ground and lay near his expensive loafers, along with a pen and a few bits of paper. When it sprang to life, so did he. In a stunningly brainless move, he lunged to answer it.<br><br>"No! Don't you touch that phone!!"<br><br>With a savage kick, the young woman sent the device flying. Then she slapped the man's head with her gun. He gave a yelp and curled back farther into the chair.<br><br>"I won't let you degrade another woman. I'd rather see you dead! Do you understand? DEAD!"<br><br>About then, I noticed something that alarmed me (even more than this mini Italian opera). My barista Dante began to inch closer to the female shooter and her loaded gun.<br><br>Bad idea.<br><br>This young woman hadn't shot anyone. Not yet, anyway.<br><br>Was she disturbed? Yes.<br><br>Homicidal? Maybe.<br><br>Enraged? Absolutely-at the guy in front of her, and that was the point. She was obviously reacting to some kind of rejection from this man, which made me certain that another man wasn't the answer to helping her see reason.</p><h2>If These Stones Could Talk: African American Presence in the Hopewell Valley, Sourland Mountain and Surrounding Regions of New Jersey</h2><p><p>Cemeteries have stories to tell, voices to unearth--and lessons from the past that we can draw upon to better shape the future. <em>If These Stones Could Talk</em> brings fresh light to a forgotten corner of American history that begins in a small cemetery in central New Jersey.</p><p>Authors of <em>If These Stones Could Talk </em>Elaine Buck and Beverly Mills started their journey through the past as two middle aged African American women with busy but quiet lives. They were both board members of the Stoutsburg Cemetery Association, a cemetery that is nestled in New Jersey's Sourland Mountain region. The cemetery was purchased by three Black men in the early 19th century to bury Blacks with honor and dignity.</p><p>When Buck and Mills got an unexpected call for help, what began as a search through the woods for gravestone markers soon had them rummaging through land deeds and making relentless calls to state officials, archeologists and reporters. Their foray into historic preservation work convinced Buck and Mills that they had a lot more work left to do to connect African American history to local and national history books--within which they still felt largely absent from the most visible narratives in United States history.</p><p>In warm but unflinching voices authors Buck and Mills offer readers a unique window into our past. These stories, including dozens of oral histories, consecrate the collected lives of a minority Black community in a predominantly White region, a pattern of community that reflects a larger, deeply important but typically overlooked national story in small towns all over the United States.</p><p> </p></p><p><p>"Organized around the stories of men and women buried in the African-American Stoutsburg cemetery near Hopewell, New Jersey, this extraordinary book narrates the history of black communities in the Hopewell Valley and Sourland Mountains over a period of nearly three centuries. The authors place these stories in the larger context of American history in the eras of slavery, the Civil War, freedom, and civil rights. Part genealogy, part history, and part personal memoir, rooted in an amazing amount of research, and written with grace and flair, this book brings to light a rich past that had almost been lost."</p><p>-- James M. McPherson, author of <em>Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era</em></p><p>"Since the founding of our country, the recorders of history have not accurately transcribed the African American experience. Much of the African American history has been deleted, misconstrued and / or misinterpreted. Elaine Buck and Beverly Mills have taken the difficult steps to change the false narrative and provide clarification for generations to come."</p><p>-- Marion T. Lane, Ed.D., Organizing Secretary General, National Society of Colonial Daughters of the Seventeenth Century</p><p>"An honest and thorough unveiling of this slice of American history has been long overdue. This is a wonderful read - a veritable page- turner. Elaine Buck and Beverly Mills are, at once, dedicated researchers and masterful story tellers. They have skillfully woven their personal experiences into a compelling multi-generational story of the formidable challenges faced and remarkable feats achieved by one localized African American community. It has broad implications for American society as a whole."</p><p>-- Peter Moock, former Professor of Economics and Education, Teachers College, Columbia University, and former Lead Education Economist, The World Bank, Africa Region and East Asia and Pacific Region</p></p><h2>The U.S. Army Leadership Field Manual</h2><p><p><b>How the world's most dynamic organization prepares its leaders for battle, with valuable insights for today's business arena</b></p> <p>For mor than 50 years, <i>The U.S. Army Leadership Field Manual </i>has provided leadership training for every officer training program in the U.S. Army.

Berlind Distinguished Professor of the Humanities at Princeton University and has been a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters since 1978.</p><p></p><i>Starred Review.</i> This hefty collection, featuring 10 new pieces along with stories culled from four decades, further establishes the prolific and wide-ranging Oates as a gifted chronicler of American culture. The theme of girls and women preyed upon by violent men appears repeatedly, as in the much-anthologized "Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?" (1970) but also in lesser-known pieces like "Small Avalanches" (1974), which turns the tables, as a 13-year-old girl, nimble and laughing, evades a middle-aged, panting lech on a deserted path. Several stories feature characters whose mental instabilities lead to violence, as in "Last Days" (1984), in which a brilliant, manic college student with a Messiah complex assassinates a rabbi, then turns the gun on himself. Though Oates's world is often ugly, she also displays a more fanciful (if still creepy) impulse; the recent piece "Fat Man My Love" finds actress "Pippi" (indubitably Tippi Hedren) puzzling over the director (an unnamed Hitchcock) who both created and ruined her career. While the lurid events of some stories have a ripped-from-the-headlines feel, Oates is never merely sensational, tracking hidden motives and emotions with a sharp eye for psychological detail&#x2014;everything conveyed in lucid, rhythmic prose. However much is made of her prodigious output, it's the consistent quality of the work that lifts Oates into the literary pantheon. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This is the kind of writing that stands up to years of bedtime repetition. . . . The author&#x2019;s best appearances are in the notes, which are often as entertaining as the stories themselves. . . . Swiftness and clarity, he says, were his guiding principles; to which he has added wit and invention. . . .

This insight raises big questions about the nature of music and the nature of humankind, and ethnomusicologists argue that to properly address these questions, we must study music in all its geographical and historical diversity.<br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, one of the foremost ethnomusicologists, Timothy Rice, offers a compact and illuminating account of this growing discipline, showing how modern researchers go about studying music from around the world, looking for insights into both music and humanity. The reader discovers that ethnomusicologists today not only examine traditional forms of music-such as Japanese gagaku, Bulgarian folk music, Javanese gamelan, or Native American drumming and singing-but also explore more contemporary musical forms, from rap and reggae to Tex-Mex, Serbian turbofolk, and even the piped-in music at the Mall of America. To investigate these diverse musical forms, Rice shows, ethnomusicologists typically live in a community, participate in and observe and record musical events, interview the musicians, their patrons, and the audience, and learn to sing, play, and dance. It's important to establish rapport with musicians and community members, and obtain the permission of those they will work with closely over the course of many months and years. We see how the researcher analyzes the data to understand how a particular musical tradition works, what is distinctive about it, and how it bears the personal, social, and cultural meanings attributed to it. Rice also discusses how researchers may apply theories from anthropology and other social sciences, to shed further light on the nature of music as a human behavior and cultural practice. <br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong><br>Oxford's <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible. Not simply a textbook of definitions, each volume in this series provides trenchant and provocative--yet always balanced and complete--discussions of the central issues in a given discipline or field. Every <em>Very Short Introduction</em> gives a readable evolution of the subject in question, demonstrating how the subject has developed and how it has influenced society. Eventually, the series will encompass every major academic discipline, offering all students an accessible and abundant reference library. Whatever the area of study that one deems important or appealing, whatever the topic that fascinates the general reader, the <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series has a handy and affordable guide that will likely prove indispensable.<br></p><p><br>Timothy Rice is Professor of Ethnomusicology and the Director of the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music at the University of California, Los Angeles. His books include May it Fill Your Soul: Experiencing Bulgarian Music and Music in Bulgaria: Experiencing Music, Expressing Culture. A leader in the field, he is a former editor of the journal Ethnomusicology and a past president of the Society for Ethnomusicology.<br><br>"Rice's short book delivers a well-structured and comparatively accessible look both into the development of ethnomusicology and into important areas of research, introduces influential studies and researchers, and can well be recommended as a concise alternative to Bruno Nettl's more comprehensive <em>The Study of Ethnomusicology</em>."--Die Musikforschung<p></p><br></p><h2>Well Spoken: Teaching Speaking to All Students</h2><p><p>All teachers at all grade levels in all subjects have speaking assignments for students, but many teachers believe they don&#x2019;t know how to teach speaking, and many even fear public speaking themselves.<br> In his new book, <i>Well Spoken</i>, veteran teacher and education consultant Erik Palmer shares the art of teaching speaking in any classroom.

Here we encounter a profound spiritual penetration into the mystery of Mary&#x2019;s unique and sublime role in our salvation. Though brief, it can be read over and over with great benefit since it is &#x2013;just as the title suggests&#x2014;both a meditation and a prayer on the meaning of Mary. This booklet also contains a brief sketch of Padre Pio&#x2019;s life and numerous edifying pictures of this saintly stigmatist.</p><p>St. Pio of Pietrelcina was born as Francesco Forgione in 1877 at Pietrelcina, Italy. At the age of five he reportedly decided to dedicate his life to God, becoming a novice of the Capuchin Friars ten years afterward with the customary vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. He received Holy Orders in 1910, and subsequently served many of the faithful as a spiritual director. Though he suffered a great deal both spiritually and physically, he always remained firm in the confidence of Jesus, Mary, and his Guardian Angel. Padre Pio was also a famed Stigmatist, and died on the twenty-third of September, 1968. He was canonized by Pope John Paul II in 2002, and his feast is celebrated on the twenty-third of September.<br></p><h2>A.D.

Sixteen-year-old Harry Haft is sent to Auschwitz. When he is forced to fight against other inmates for the amusement of the SS officers, Haft shows extraordinary strength and courage, and a determination to survive. As the Soviet Army advances in April 1945, he makes a daring escape from the Nazis. After negotiating the turmoil of postwar Poland, Haft immigrates to the United States and establishes himself as a professional prizefighter, remaining undefeated until he faces heavy�weight champion Rocky Marciano in 1949. In <i>The Boxer</i>, Reinhard Kleist reveals another side to the steely Harry Haft: a man struggling to escape the memories of the fianc�e he left behind in Poland. This is a powerful and moving graphic novel about love and the will to survive.</p><p>Reinhard Kleist has written a number of critically acclaimed graphic novels, among them the award-winning biographies <i>Havana: A Cuban Journey</i> (2008), <i>Johnny Cash: I See a Darkness</i> (Abrams ComicArts, 2009), and <i>Castro</i> (2010). Kleist lives in Berlin, Germany.The author of previous graphic biographies of Johnny Cash and Fidel Castro, Kleist recounts another true story of a turbulent life with this portrayal of Harry Haft, a Polish Jew who literally fought his way to survival in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Taking note of his strength and resilience, the guards enter him in boxing matches set up for the amusement of the SS officers. Haft defeats every opponent before escaping from a death march as the Soviet Red Army approaches. Immigrating to the U.S. after the war, he embarks on a professional boxing career, culminating in a match with future heavyweight champion Rocky Marciano. While Haft&#x2019;s bouts in Auschwitz were driven by a desire to continue living, his American fights were motivated by hope of achieving fame so that the fianc�e he lost in Poland would hear of his success. Kleist&#x2019;s expressive, inky brushwork powerfully conveys Haft&#x2019;s harrowing story. Although Haft might not be as famous as Kleist&#x2019;s previous subjects, his tale of survival by any means is equally enthralling. --Gordon Flagg</p><h2>The Architecture Of Light (2nd Edition): A textbook of procedures and practices for the Architect, Interior Designer and Lighting Designer.</h2><p>Welcome to the Second Edition!

After reading <em>Primetime Propaganda</em>, you&#x2019;ll never watch TV the same way again.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Mark Levin</p><p>Movie critic Michael Medved calls Ben Shapiro, &#x201c;One of our most refreshing and insightful voices on the popular culture, as well as a conscience for his much-maligned generation.&#x201d; With <em>Primetime Propaganda,</em> the syndicated columnist and bestselling author of <em>Brainwashed, Porn Generation</em>, and <em>Project President</em> tells the shocking true story of how the most powerful medium of mass communication in human history became a vehicle for spreading the radical agenda of the left side of the political spectrum. Similar to what Bernard Goldberg&#x2019;s <em>Bias </em>and <em>A Slobbering Love Affair</em> did for the liberal news machine, Shapiro&#x2019;s <em>Primetime Propaganda</em> is an essential expos� of corrupting media bias, pulling back the curtain on widespread and unrepentant abuses of the Hollywood entertainment industry.<br></p></p><p><p><em>Primetime Propaganda</em> is the story of how television has been used over the past sixty years by Hollywood writers, producers, actors, and executives to promote their liberal ideals, to push the envelope on social and political issues, and to shape America in their own leftist image.</p><p>In this thoroughly researched and detailed history of the television industry, the conservative columnist and bestselling author Ben Shapiro argues that left-leaning entertainment kingpins in Los Angeles and New York have leveraged&#x2014;and continue to use&#x2014;their positions and power to push liberal messages and to promote the Democratic Party while actively discriminating against their opponents on the right. According to Shapiro, television isn't just about entertainment&#x2014;it's an attempt to convince Americans that the social, economic, and foreign policy shaped by leftism is morally righteous.</p><p>But don't take his word for it. Shapiro interviewed more than one hundred of the industry's biggest players, including Larry Gelbart (<em>M*A*S*H</em>), Marta Kauffman (<em>Friends</em>), David Shore (<em>House</em>), and Mark Burnett (<em>Survivor</em>). Many of these insiders boast that not only is Hollywood biased against conservatives, but that many of the shows being broadcast have secret political messages. After reading this groundbreaking expos�, readers will never watch television the same way again.</p><p>Ben Shapiro is editor-in-chief of <em>The Daily Wire</em> and host of "The Ben Shapiro Show," the top conservative podcast in the nation. A <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author, Shapiro is a graduate of Harvard Law School, and an Orthodox Jew, his work has been profiled in nearly every major American publication, and he has appeared on hundreds of radio and television shows. He has appeared as the featured speaker at many conservative events on campuses nationwide, several of those appearances targeted by progressive and &#x201c;Antifa&#x201d; activists.</p></p><h2>Basics of Christian Education</h2><p>Congregations are always struggling with what quality Christian education is and how to build and maintain it.

But no one could have foreseen that the greatest success story to arise from these events would be the worldwide rise of organized crime. Today, it is estimated that illegal trade accounts for one-fifth of the global GDP.<br><br>In this fearless and wholly authoritative investigation of the seemingly insatiable demand for illegal wares, veteran reporter Misha Glenny travels across five continents to speak with participants from every level of the global underworld--police, victims, politicians, and even the criminals themselves. What follows is a groundbreaking, propulsive look at an unprecedented phenomenon from a savvy, street-wise guide.</p></p><p>Amazon Significant Seven, April 2008: In <i>McMafia</i>, Misha Glenny draws the dark map that lies on the other side of Tom Friedman's bright flat world. That connected globe not only brings software coders and supply-chain outsourcers closer together; it's also opened the gates to a criminal network of unsettling vastness, complexity, and efficiency that represents a fifth of the earth's economy, trading in everything from untaxed cigarettes and the usual narcotics to human lives and nuclear material. Glenny's a Balkans expert, and he begins his story there, with the illicit--but often state-sponsored--underworld that grew out of the post-Soviet chaos, but he soon follows the contraband everywhere from Mumbai and Johannesburg to rural Colombia and the U.S. suburbs. It's not just a hodgepodge of scare clips, though: Glenny reports from the ground but follows the leads as high as they go, showing how the dark and bright sides of the flat world are more connected than we imagine. <i>--Tom Nissley</i><b>MISHA GLENNY</b>&nbsp;is the author of&nbsp;<i>DarkMarket, McMafia, The Rebirth of History, The Fall of Yugoslavia&nbsp;</i>(which won the Overseas Press Club Award in 1993 for Best Book on Foreign Affairs) and&nbsp;<i>The Balkans: Nationalism, War, and the Great Powers, 1804&#x2013;1999.</i>&nbsp;He was a BBC Central Europe correspondent&#x2014;he covered the fall of Communism and the wars in the former Yugoslavia&#x2014;and has been regularly consulted by the U.S. and European governments on major policy issues.

Beale offers a substantive evangelical commentary on Colossians and Philemon. With extensive research and thoughtful chapter-by-chapter exegesis, Beale leads readers through all aspects of Colossians and Philemon--sociological, historical, and theological--to help them better understand the meaning and relevance of these biblical books.<br><br>As with all BECNT volumes, this commentary features the author's detailed interaction with the Greek text and an acclaimed, user-friendly design. It admirably achieves the dual aims of the series--academic sophistication with pastoral sensitivity and accessibility--making it a useful tool for pastors, church leaders, students, and teachers.</p><p>"As we have come to expect from Beale's notable scholarship, this commentary on Colossians and Philemon models how thorough research, keen attention to Old Testament allusions, and meticulous study of the Greek text provide a basis for incisive, theologically grounded preaching and teaching. It should take its place on the shelf of definitive commentaries on the New Testament that truly help in these tasks."<br>--<b>David&nbsp;E. Garland</b>, Truett Theological Seminary, Baylor University<br><br>"Beale's commentary is everything we have come to expect from a veteran New Testament scholar. His exegesis is detailed and rich in insight and theologically profound, and his emphasis on the fulfillment of the temple in Colossians is illuminating. Old Testament allusions are mined, helping readers to see how Colossians and Philemon fit within the entire biblical witness. For pastors, students, and professors, Beale's work on these two letters will prove invaluable in their own research and study."<br>--<b>Thomas&nbsp;R. Schreiner</b>, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary<br><br>"This fresh and readable commentary on Colossians and Philemon is marked not only by impressive erudition and judicious judgment on complex issues but also by extraordinary theological depth. It breaks new ground, especially in the area of the biblical and Jewish roots of Paul's teaching in Colossians. Highly recommended for scholars and students as well as pastors and teachers."<br>--<b>Brian&nbsp;S. Rosner</b>, Ridley College, Australia<br><br>"Beale skillfully guides the reader through the many interpretive issues and uses the relevant historical information to illuminate the context of Colossians and Philemon. An outstanding exegetical commentary that I will gladly recommend to anyone wanting to explore the riches of these two letters."<br>--<b>Clinton&nbsp;E. Arnold</b>, Talbot School of Theology, Biola University<br><br>"Scholars and pastors will benefit immensely from this commentary. It will undoubtedly be a standard work, both in studies of Colossians specifically and in Pauline studies more generally."<br>--<b>Eckhard&nbsp;J.

Simply put, beliefs come first and explanations for beliefs follow. The brain, Shermer argues, is a belief engine. Using sensory data that flow in through the senses, the brain naturally begins to look for and find patterns, and then infuses those patterns with meaning, forming beliefs. Once beliefs are formed the brain begins to look for and find confirmatory evidence in support of those beliefs, accelerating the process of reinforcing them, and round and round the process goes in a positive-feedback loop. </p><p>In <i>The Believing Brain, </i>Shermer provides countless real-world examples of how this process operates, from politics, economics, and religion to conspiracy theories, the supernatural, and the paranormal. And ultimately, he demonstrates why science is the best tool ever devised to determine whether or not our beliefs match reality.</p></p><p><p>MICHAEL SHERMER is the author of <i>Why People Believe Weird Things</i>, <i>The Science of Good and Evil</i>, and eight other books on the evolution of human beliefs and behavior. He is the founding publisher of <i>Skeptic </i>magazine, the editor of Skeptic.com, a monthly columnist for <i>Scientific American</i>, and an adjunct professor at Claremont Graduate University. He lives in Southern California.</p><p><b>1</b></p><p><b>Mr. D&#x2019;Arpino&#x2019;s Dilemma</b></p><p>The voice was as distinct as the message it delivered was unmistakable. Emilio &#x201c;Chick&#x201d; D&#x2019;Arpino bolted upright from his bed, startled that the words he heard so clearly were not spoken by anyone in the room. It was 4 a.m. on February 11, 1966, and Mr. D&#x2019;Arpino was alone in his bedroom, seemingly unperturbed by what he was hearing. It wasn&#x2019;t a masculine voice, yet neither was it feminine. And even though he had no reference guide built by experience from which to compare, Mr. D&#x2019;Arpino somehow knew that the source was not of this world.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>I met Chick D&#x2019;Arpino on my forty-seventh birthday, September 8, 2001, just three days before the calamitous event that would henceforth cleave history into pre- and post-9/11. Chick wanted to know if I would be willing to write an essay to answer this question:&nbsp;<i>Is it possible to know if there is a source out there that knows we are here?</i></p><p>&#x201c;Uh? You mean God?&#x201d; I queried.</p><p>&#x201c;Not necessarily,&#x201d; Chick replied.</p><p>&#x201c;ET?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; Chick continued, &#x201c;but I don&#x2019;t want to specify the nature of the source, just that it is out there and not here.&#x201d;</p><p>Who would ask such a question, I wondered, and more important,&nbsp;<i>why</i>? Chick explained that he was a retired bricklayer interested in pursuing answers to deep questions through essay contests and one-day conferences he was sponsoring at San Jose State University and at Stanford University, near his home in Silicon Valley. I had never heard of a retired bricklayer sponsoring conferences before, so this got my attention, as I have long admired autodidacts.</p><p>Over the years, as Chick and I became close friends, I grew more and more curious to know why a bricklayer would spend what little money he had on funding essay contests and conferences to answer life&#x2019;s big questions. I had a sense that Chick already knew the answers to the questions he was posing, but for a decade he took the Fifth with me until one day, when I probed one more time, he gave me a hint:</p><p><i>I had an experience.</i></p><p>An experience. Okay! Now we&#x2019;re talking my language&#x2014;the language of belief systems grounded in experiences. What type of experience?</p><p>Chick clammed up again, but I pushed and prodded for details. When was this experience?</p><p><i>Back in 1966.</i></p><p>What time of day did it happen?</p><p><i>Four in the morning.</i></p><p>Did you see or hear something?</p><p><i>I don&#x2019;t want to talk about that aspect of it.</i></p><p>But if it was a profound enough experience to be driving you to this day to explore such big questions, it is surely worth sharing with someone.</p><p><i>Nope, it&#x2019;s private.</i></p><p>Come on, Chick, I&#x2019;ve known you practically a decade. We&#x2019;re the best of friends. I&#x2019;m genuinely curious.</p><p><i>Okay, it was a voice.</i></p><p>A voice. Um.</p><p><i>I know what you&#x2019;re thinking, Michael&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve read all your stuff about auditory hallucinations, lucid dreams, and sleep paralysis. But that&#x2019;s not what happened to me. This was clearly, distinctly, unmistakably not from my mind. It was from an outside source.</i></p><p>Now we were getting somewhere. Here is a man I&#x2019;ve come to know and love as a dear friend, a man who otherwise is as sane as the next guy and as smart as a whip. I needed to know more. Where did this happen?</p><p><i>At my sister&#x2019;s house.</i></p><p>What were you doing sleeping at your sister&#x2019;s house?</p><p><i>I was separated from my wife and going through a divorce.</i></p><p>Aha, right, the stress of divorce.</p><p><i>I know, I know, my psychiatrist thought the same thing you&#x2019;re thinking now&#x2014;stress caused the experience.</i></p><p>A psychiatrist? How does a bricklayer end up in the office of a psychiatrist?</p><p><i>Well, see, the authorities sent me to see this psychiatrist up at Agnews State Hospital.</i></p><p>What?! Why?</p><p><i>I wanted to see the president.</i></p><p>Okay, let&#x2019;s see&nbsp;... 1966&nbsp;... President Lyndon Johnson&nbsp;... Vietnam War protests&nbsp;... construction worker wants to see the president&nbsp;... mental hospital. There&#x2019;s a compelling story here for someone who studies the power of belief for a living, so I pressed for more.</p><p>Why did you want to see the president?</p><p><i>To deliver to him the message from the source of the voice.</i></p><p>What was the message?</p><p><i>That I will never tell you, Michael&#x2014;I have never told anyone and I&#x2019;m taking it to my grave. I haven&#x2019;t even told my children.</i></p><p>Wow, this must be some message, like Moses on the mountaintop taking dictation from Yahweh. Must have gone on for quite some time. How long?</p><p><i>Less than a minute.</i></p><p>Less than a minute?</p><p><i>It was thirteen words.</i></p><p>Do you remember the thirteen words?</p><p><i>Of course!</i></p><p>Come on, Chick, tell me what they were.</p><p><i>Nope.</i></p><p>Did you write them down somewhere?</p><p><i>Nope</i>.</p><p>Can I guess what the theme of the message was?</p><p><i>Sure, go ahead, take a guess</i>.</p><p>Love.</p><p><i>Michael! Yes! That&#x2019;s exactly right.</i>&nbsp;Love.&nbsp;<i>The source not only knows we&#x2019;re here, but it loves us and we can have a relationship with it.</i></p><p><b>The Source</b></p><p>I would like to understand what happened to my friend Chick D&#x2019;Arpino on that early morning in February 1966 and how that experience changed his life in profound ways ever since. I want to comprehend what happened to Chick because I want to know what happens to all of us when we form beliefs.</p><p>In Chick&#x2019;s case the experience happened while separated from his wife and children. The details of the separation are not important (and he wishes to protect the privacy of his family), but its effects are. &#x201c;I was a broken man,&#x201d; Chick told me.1&nbsp;&#x201c;I was broke in every way you can think of: financially, physically, emotionally, and psychologically.&#x201d;</p><p>To this day Chick maintains that what he experienced was unquestionably outside of his mind. I strongly suspect otherwise, so what follows is my interpretation. Lying alone in bed, Chick was awake and perhaps anxious about the new dawn that would soon break over his day and life. Away from his beloved wife and children, Chick was troubled by the uncertainty of where his life would go from there, restless about which path before him to take, and especially apprehensive about whether he was loved. Those of us who have felt the sting of unrequited love, the anguish of relationship uncertainty, the torturous suffering of a troubled marriage, or the soul-shattering desolation of divorce, well know the painful inner turmoil that stirs the emotional lees&#x2014;stomach-churning, heart-pounding, stress-hormone-pumping fight-or-flight emotional overdrive&#x2014;especially in the wee hours of the morning before the sun signals the possibility of redemption.</p><p>I have experienced such emotions myself, so perhaps I am projecting. My parents divorced when I was four, and although detailed memories of the separation and disruption are foggy, one memory is as clear to me now as it was those late nights and early mornings while lying awake: I had an almost vertigo sense of spiraling down and shrinking into my bed, as the room I was in expanded outward in all directions, leaving me feeling ever smaller and insignificant, frightened and anxious about&nbsp;... well&nbsp;... everything, including and especially being loved. And although the ever-shrinking-room experience has mercifully receded, today there are still too many late nights and early mornings when lost-love anxieties return to haunt me, emotions that I usually wash away with productive work or physical exercise, sometimes (but not always) successfully.</p><p>What happened to Chick next can best be described as surreal, ethereal, and otherworldly. On that early morning in February 1966, a soothing, tranquil voice calmly delivered a message of what I imagine a mind racked in turmoil longed to hear:</p><p><i>You are loved by a higher source that wants your love in return</i>.</p><p>I do not know if these are the exact thirteen words heard by Chick D&#x2019;Arpino that morning, and he&#x2019;s still not talking, other than to exposit:</p><p><i>The meaning was love between the source and me. The source identified its relationship to me and my relationship to it. And it dealt with L-O-V-E. If I had to say what it was about, it was about the mutual love we have for one another, me and the source, the source and me.</i></p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>How does one make sense of a supernatural occurrence with natural explanations? This is Mr. D&#x2019;Arpino&#x2019;s dilemma.</p><p>I am burdened by no such dilemma because I do not believe in otherworldly forces. Chick&#x2019;s experience follows from the plausible causal scenario I am constructing here for what I believe to be an inner source of that outer voice. Since the brain does not perceive itself or its inner operations, and our normal experience is of stimuli entering the brain through the senses from the outside, when a neural network misfires or otherwise sends a signal to some other part of the brain that resembles an outside stimulus, the brain naturally interprets these internal events as external phenomena. This happens both naturally and artificially&#x2014;lots of people experience auditory and visual hallucinations under varying conditions, including stress, and copious research that I will review in detail later demonstrates how easy it is to artificially trigger such illusory ephemera.</p><p>Regardless of the actual source of the voice, what does one do after such an experience? Chick picked up the story and recounted for me one of the most transfixing tales I&#x2019;ve ever heard.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p><i>It happened on a Friday.

Fragrant Darjeelings, malty Assams, and her current favorite, a house-blended orchid plum tea that tickled her fancy as well as her taste buds.</p><p>On the other hand, how often did a girl get invited to a fancy wine-tasting party at the very upscale Knighthall Winery?</p><p>Rarely. In fact, tonight was a first for Theodosia. And her invitation to this lushly groomed vineyard, located a leisurely drive from Charleston, South Carolina, came at the behest of Drayton Conneley, her right-hand man and tea expert at the Indigo Tea Shop. Luckily for Theodosia, Drayton happened to be a dear friend of Jordan Knight, Knighthall Winery&#x2019;s slightly flamboyant proprietor.</p><p>&#x201c;You see?&#x201d; said Drayton, grabbing her elbow and steering her toward an enormous trestle table set under a spreading live oak. He was sixty-something and still debonair with a prominent nose and thatch of gray hair. &#x201c;Jordan managed to produce four completely different varieties of wine.&#x201d; Wine bottles beckoned like shiny beacons, and attentive waiters were more than willing to fill glasses. &#x201c;Amazing, wouldn&#x2019;t you say?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Amazing,&#x201d; Theodosia echoed. She didn&#x2019;t know if four varieties was a feat worth celebrating, but Drayton certainly seemed impressed. And the grounds of the winery did look absolutely magical this September evening, all lit up and sparkling like a scene from some elegant Austrian fairy tale. Plantation oaks and pecan trees were iced in silvery lights, candles floated in a free-form pool, a string quartet played lively music, and a handsome magician in white tie and tails amused guests with fluttering, disappearing pigeons and sly card tricks.</p><p>Drayton handed Theodosia a crystal flute filled with white wine. &#x201c;This is Knighthall&#x2019;s White Shadow,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;Although I&#x2019;d call it more of a Riesling.&#x201d;</p><p>Theodosia took a small sip and found the wine to be utterly delicious. Crisp and aromatic, with hints of apples and citrus. Not unlike a fine oolong tea. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s spectacular,&#x201d; she replied.</p><p>&#x201c;I told you,&#x201d; said Drayton. &#x201c;Lots of folks thought it would be next to impossible to grow grapes out here on Wadmalow Island, but Jordan&#x2019;s definitely proved them wrong.&#x201d;</p><p>If tea plants could grow here and flourish, Theodosia thought to herself, why not grape vines? Although perhaps a sandier soil was needed? Wasn&#x2019;t a sandier, rockier soil supposed to prove the true mettle of the grape?</p><p>They stepped away from the tasting table and looked around, enjoying the warmth and excitement of the evening and the rather excellent people watching.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d say the cr�me de la cr�me of Charleston is here in full force tonight,&#x201d; said Theodosia. Tanned and toned women in chiffon dresses drifted by, wafting perfumed scents that hinted at lilies and lilacs. Men in seersucker suits also wandered the elegant grounds, sipping wine as well as an occasional tumbler of bourbon. Of course, Charleston folk being the congenial sort, everyone seemed quite preoccupied with the exchange of air kisses and pleasantries, pretending not to notice if they themselves were being noticed.</p><p>&#x201c;The beautiful people,&#x201d; Drayton mused. &#x201c;Dressed to the nines just in case a society photographer should happen along.&#x201d; Of course, he was also dazzling in a blue-and-white seersucker suit&#x2014;a sartorial Southern statement that was punctuated by his trademark red bow tie.</p><p>Theodosia would have denied it, of course, practically laughed in your face, but she was also one of the beautiful people. With an abundance of auburn hair that might have inspired a painter like Raphael, creamy English skin, and sparkling blue eyes, she looked like she might have slipped in from another, earlier, century. She was bold yet tactful, filled with dreams and yet practical for her thirty-some years. Her only flaws were that she tended to wear her heart on her sleeve and often rushed in where proverbial angels feared to tread.</p><p>&#x201c;Jordan!&#x201d; Drayton called out as Jordan Knight, the owner of Knighthall Winery, came up to greet them. &#x201c;Congratulations on such a fine turnout.&#x201d; He turned to include Theodosia. &#x201c;And this is Theodosia Browning, I don&#x2019;t believe you two have met.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks for coming,&#x201d; said Knight as he shook hands with each of them. He was midforties, with a shock of salt-and-pepper hair, watery blue eyes, and a slightly pink complexion. He&#x2019;d removed his jacket, loosened his tie, and his manner seemed to veer between nervous and ebullient.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty sure I just convinced the owner of the Lady Goodwood Inn to carry my wine,&#x201d; Knight chortled. In his other, more practical life, he was the CEO of Whizzen Software. Knighthall Winery was his most recently established passion.</p><p>&#x201c;Well done,&#x201d; said Drayton, clapping his friend on the back. </p><p>&#x201c;Your winery appears to be thriving,&#x201d; Theodosia told Knight. Being a business owner herself, she knew how difficult it was for a company to succeed, let alone flourish, in today&#x2019;s tough business climate. And the deck was stacked against upstarts even more.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re starting to gain some traction,&#x201d; Knight responded. &#x201c;We have distribution to thirty liquor stores in something like five states. And my son is in the process of helping to negotiate a potentially large deal with a Japanese distributor, as well.&#x201d; Knight gazed about distractedly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve met my son, Drew, haven&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>Drayton nodded yes. Theodosia shook her head no.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to say hello to him,&#x201d; said Drayton. &#x201c;Is he here tonight?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Drew&#x2019;s around here somewhere,&#x201d; said Knight as he cast a quick glance at the large crowd and shrugged. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s no doubt managing all the behind-the-scenes activity.&#x201d; Now he glanced nervously at his watch.</p><p>&#x201c;Relax,&#x201d; Drayton told him. &#x201c;This is your big night. Enjoy it!&#x201d;</p><p>Knight grimaced. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a little antsy about my presentation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What is that?&#x201d; Theodosia inquired politely.</p><p>&#x201c;In about five minutes,&#x201d; said Knight, &#x201c;we&#x2019;re going to do a special barrel tasting of our new cabernet reserve.&#x201d; He flashed a perfunctory smile. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re calling it Knight Music.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Catchy,&#x201d; said Theodosia.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re pinning all our hopes on this one,&#x201d; said Knight. &#x201c;Going for broke.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m guessing that several of Charleston&#x2019;s food and wine critics are in attendance tonight?&#x201d; said Drayton.</p><p>Knight nodded. &#x201c;We invited anybody and everybody who can give us a mention, article, or shout-out. After five years of moving heaven and earth to produce four varieties of muscadine grapes, it&#x2019;s all come down to this one make-or-break moment.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good luck to you then,&#x201d; said Theodosia as Knight hurried away.</p><p>Theodosia and Drayton edged their way slowly through the crowd, in the direction Jordan had gone. A makeshift stage had been set up just outside a large, hip-roofed barn, and two workers were rolling out an enormous oak barrel. Two Japanese men, both wearing white suits and standing ramrod-stiff, stood nearby, watching intently.</p><p>Theodosia gave Drayton a nudge. &#x201c;Those must be the Japanese distributors your friend Jordan mentioned.&#x201d;</p><p>Drayton nodded. &#x201c;I read a recent article in the Financial Times about how the Japanese are suddenly head-over-heels crazy for wine. Particularly the pricier ones.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sake being so last year,&#x201d; said Theodosia.</p><p>&#x201c;Everything is cyclical,&#x201d; said Drayton, trying to sound practical.</p><p>&#x201c;Except for tea,&#x201d; said Theodosia. &#x201c;Tea just seems to keep gaining in popularity.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And aren&#x2019;t we glad for that,&#x201d; said Drayton.</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me . . . Theodosia?&#x201d; said a voice at their elbow.</p><p>Theodosia turned with a smile and her eyes met those of a good-looking man with piercing green eyes and a mop of curly blond hair. Kind of surfer dude meets buttoned-down lawyer. He was smiling back at her, and with a kind of instinctive knowledge, she realized that she knew him. The man&#x2019;s name was Andrew something. Andrew . . .</p><p>&#x201c;Andrew Turner,&#x201d; said the man, filling in the blank for her, bobbing his head. &#x201c;We met at my gallery a couple of weeks ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; said Theodosia. &#x201c;Max brought me to one of your openings&#x2014;you were featuring all sorts of dynamic, contemporary oil paintings as I recall.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where you undoubtedly feasted on cheap white wine and stuffed cherry tomatoes,&#x201d; said Turner. &#x201c;The hopeful gallery owner&#x2019;s stock-in-trade.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t recall the wine,&#x201d; said Theodosia, &#x201c;but I do remember a wonderful painting that you had on display. All reds and purples and golds. Subtle but also very visceral. The artist was . . . James somebody?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Richard James,&#x201d; said Turner. &#x201c;You have a very keen eye. And as luck would have it, that particular piece is still for sale if you&#x2019;re interested.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me think about it,&#x201d; said Theodosia. She hastily introduced Turner to Drayton, then they all paused as a passing waiter stopped with his tray of hors d&#x2019;oeuvres to offer them mini crab cakes and shrimp wrapped in bacon.</p><p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you drop by again during the Paint and Palette Art Crawl,&#x201d; Turner suggested. &#x201c;You know it kicks off this Wednesday.&#x201d;</p><p>Theodosia was about to answer, when Drayton quickly shushed them. Jordan Knight was standing on the stage next to an enormous weathered oak barrel. And it looked as if he was about to begin his speech.</p><p>The crowd hushed en masse and pressed forward to hear his presentation.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you all for coming,&#x201d; said Knight. &#x201c;This is such a proud moment for me.&#x201d; He clasped a hand to his chest in a heartfelt gesture of appreciation. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve labored long and hard to cultivate grapes here in South Carolina.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a spatter of applause.</p><p>&#x201c;And our newest vintage, Knight Music, which you are all about to taste, would never have been possible without the hard work of my manager, Tom Grady, and our many dedicated workers.&#x201d; Jordan extended a hand toward a red-haired woman who stood off to the side. &#x201c;And, of course, I must thank my wonderful family. My wife, the amazing Pandora Knight, and my son, Drew Knight.&#x201d; He smiled as his eyes searched the crowd for Drew. When he didn&#x2019;t find him, he said, &#x201c;Though my son seems to be missing in action at the moment.&#x201d;</p><p>There was more laughter and guffaws from the crowd. </p><p>As Jordan continued his speech, two workers began to tap the large barrel of wine. They fumbled around on the top, trying to get a spigot going, but it didn&#x2019;t seem to be working. </p><p>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; said Jordan, playing to the crowd now, &#x201c;our winery is not without problems&#x2014;as you can plainly see.&#x201d; One of the workers tilted the large barrel up onto one edge. The other worker, looking frustrated and brandishing a crowbar, suddenly popped off the round, wooden top. The heavy lid went airborne, spinning in the air like an errant Frisbee, and then hit the stage with a loud bang. At that very same moment, the entire barrel seemed to teeter dangerously.</p><p>&#x201c;Whoa!&#x201d; Jordan shouted. &#x201c;Careful there. We&#x2019;re going to sample that fine wine.&#x201d;</p><p>But the giant barrel, unbalanced and heavy with wine, was more than the workers could handle. They fought valiantly to right it, but were beginning to lose their grip.</p><p>Slowly, the barrel tipped sideways and viscous red liquid began to spill out, sloshing across the stage and spattering the crowd. There were sharp cries of dismay from the guests as everyone tried to jump out of the way.</p><p>Jordan Knight scrambled for the barrel in a last-ditch effort to avert total disaster. He leaned down and tried to muscle his shoulder beneath the huge barrel. Unfortunately, the laws of physics had been set into motion and he was clearly too late. The barrel continued to tip, rolling over in slow motion like a sinking ocean liner making a final, dying gasp.</p><p>The barrel landed on its side with a deafening crash, and torrents of red wine gushed out like rivers of blood.</p><p>Now horrified gasps rose up from the crowd as Jordan Knight seemed to stagger drunkenly. He crumpled to his knees, landing hard, and his entire face seemed to collapse. Then an agonized shriek rose up from his lips, blotting out the music and even the gasps from the crowd.</p><p>Curiosity bubbling within her, Theodosia pushed her way through the crowd to see what on earth was going on.</p><p>And was completely shocked to see the body of a dead man lying on the stage!</p><p>He was curled up, nose to knees, like a pickled fish. His head was tilted forward, his arms clutched close across his chest. The man&#x2019;s skin, what Theodosia could see of it, was practically purple from being submerged inside the barrel of red wine.</p><p>Who? and What? were the first thoughts that formed like a cartoon bubble deep in Theodosia&#x2019;s brain. And then her eyes flicked over to Jordan Knight, who was kneeling in the spill of wine, his pant legs completely soaked with purple as tears streamed down his face and his arms flailed madly about his head.</p><p>From the look of utter devastation on Jordan Knight&#x2019;s face, Theodosia was pretty sure he&#x2019;d found his missing son.</p></p><h2>From Indians to Chicanos: The Dynamics of Mexican-American Culture</h2><p>Anthropologist-historian James Diego Vigil distills an enormous amount of information to provide a perceptive ethnohistorical introduction to the Mexican-American experience in the United States.

Outside of traditional monogamy, relationship structure options and guidelines are often murky at best. This book seeks to demystify the basics of healthy, consensual non-monogamy by sharing the lessons learned from both Minx and thousands of podcast listeners who have built successful polyamorous relationships. While each relationship may be different, some basic guidelines are helpful in constructing one&#39;s own version of polyamory, and the eight discoveries outlined in this book seek to provide just that.</p><p>Cunning Minx is the sultry-voiced producer and host of the Polyamory Weekly podcast, now with over 400 episodes in production. The free weekly podcast shares tales from the front of responsible non-monogamy from a pansexual, kink-friendly point of view. A kinky boobiesexual, Minx founded the show in 2005 as a resource for the poly and poly-curious to form community, share experiences and help guide each other on their journeys of poly and kinky exploration. The podcast is the longest-running polyamory podcast and winner of the 2007 Erotic Award for Best Podcast as well as receiving accolades from ErosZine, Fleshbot and the Chicago Sun-Times. Minx has given dozens of lectures on polyamory, BDSM and social media activism at poly, kinky and science fiction confer-ences around the United States.

Norton,2006, Binding: Paperback</p><p>A greater awareness of multiracial people is underway. Dozens of web sites devoted to multiracial issues have sprung up across the Internet, and they are frequented by tens of thousands of new visitors each year. Celebrities of mixed-race are now mainstays of music and movies. Think Halle Berry, Norah Jones, and Lenny Kravitz. Multiracial sports stars like Derek Jeter and Tiger Woods continue to snag the spotlight. In fact, in a country that is undeniably race-conscious, multiracial people are well on their way to being focal rather than peripheral. <p>The old adage is that writers should write about what they know. In Mixed, this is precisely what they do. Multiracial authors draw upon their own experiences in identity negotiation as they construct their prose. Because multiracial people are united only by the fact that they not easily categorizeable, the stories in this collection are as divergent as the writers themselves. Yet when taken together, they reflect a singular spirit, one of nonconformity in a world where people continue to ask the question--"What are you?"--and then wait for a one word response.</p>Pradsad's Outwitting the Job Market included meditations on diversity and the workplace; her choice of fiction over nonfiction for this anthology may reflect her own shifts: her novel One of the Boys is due in 2007. All of the contributors are from mixed or multiracial backgrounds; Prasad notes in her foreword that there is "some commonality" among them: "being proof of an increasingly global society, acting as the solder between various communities, straddling cultural expectations." In "Footnote," memoirist Carmit Delman (Burnt Bread and Chutney) writes of a quarter-Indian girl raised in West Virginia who takes a carnal route to discovering identity. Mat Johnson's "Gift Giving" uses the typical story of the cuckold (the author dedicates the story to an ex-fiance) to dispel numerous clich�s of biracial coupledom: "The women I knew who socialized white always had some mythic white ex-boyfriend to whom no Negro could compare." In "The Caste System," Mary Yukari Waters (The Laws of Evening) sends Sarah Rexford to Japan with her grandmother for a visit to her mother's grave, and to her aunt Kimiko. There are short author bios written by the writers themselves, and thumbnail photos of each author. At the end of each of the 18 stories, the writer gives a brief description of what inspired it. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Part I of the book reminds us that an individual or a church can teach sound doctrine, be faithful to the gospel, be morally upright and hard-working, and yet be lacking love and therefore, be displeasing to Christ. Love can grow cold while outward religious performance appears acceptable--even praiseworthy. <br>Part Two of <i>Love or Die</i> presents practical ways to cultivate love in the local church, including chapters that challenge us to Study Love, Pray for Love, Teach Love, Model Love, Guard Love and Practice Love. <br>A five-lesson study guide is included, making this an exceptional tool for classes and small groups. <br>"Jesus commanded us to love God with all our heart, soul, and mind, and to love our neighbor as ourselves. Yet few Christians take those commands seriously. Alexander Strauch does, and in <i>Love or Die: Christ's Wake-up Call to the Church</i>, he helps us understand how to apply Jesus' commands both as individuals, and corporately in our churches. All believers will benefit from a serious study of this book." -- Jerry Bridges, author <i>Pursuit of Holiness</i></p><p>Strauch has been a teacher and an elder at Littleton Bible Chapel for the past 25 years.</p><h2>In Defense of Purity: An Analysis of the Catholic Ideals of Purity and Virginity</h2><p><p><strong>A probing meditation on the nature, value, and beauty of purity, <em>In Defense of Purity</em> is not a book of sexual ethics, nor a &#x201c;how-to&#x201d; guide to purity&#x2014;but for readers with open minds and hearts, the book promises to be transformative.</strong></p><p>When Dietrich von Hildebrand converted to Catholicism in 1914, he was surprised to find that, despite an abundance of books on the dangers of impurity, there were practically none on the positive values of purity. &#x201c;So,&#x201d; writes <strong>Alice von Hildebrand</strong>, widow of Dietrich, in a new foreword to the book, &#x201c;this is what he set out to do in <em>In Defense of Purity</em>: to explore purity as a positive reality and only in light of its beauty to describe its contrary.&#x201d;</p><p>First published in 1927, <em>In Defense of Purity</em> anticipates many of the most pressing social issues of our day.

Inside her mud adobe home with her missionary parents and three sisters, she enjoyed American family life. Outside, her world was shaped by drums and the joy cry; Jeep and mule treks into the countryside; ostriches on the air strip; and the crackle of several Ethiopian languages she barely understood but longed to learn. </p> <p>She felt she&#x2019;d been exiled to a foreign country when she went to Illinois for college. She returned to Ethiopia to teach, only to discover how complex working in another culture and language really is. Life under a Communist dictatorship meant constant outages&#x2015;water, electricity, sugar, even toilet paper. But she was willing to do anything, no matter how hard, to live in Ethiopia again. Yet the chaos only increased&#x2015;guerillas marched down from the north, their t-shirts crisscrossed by Kalashnikov bandoliers. When peace returned, Caroline got the chance she&#x2019;d longed for, to revisit that beloved childhood home in Maji. But maybe it would have been better just to treasure the memories. </p> <p><b>Caroline Kurtz</b> speaks Amharic fluently and spearheads development in Ethiopia&#x2019;s Maji District, introducing apples, solar energy, and women&#x2019;s cottage industries.</p></p><p>From the age of five, Caroline Kurtz grew up in Ethiopia, the child of Presbyterian church missionaries. The family lived in the church&#x2019;s most remote mission station in the mountainous regions of southwestern Ethiopia near the town of Maji. Beginning at the age of ten, Caroline attended boarding school in Addis Ababa and then Alexandria, Egypt. Caroline left for college in the United States at eighteen, unprepared for U.S. culture. She eventually married a childhood sweetheart, also the child of American missionaries to Ethiopia, and the couple eventually returned with their family to live and work in Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Sudan. She and her sister, the American children&#x2019;s author Jane Kurtz, recently launched Ready Set go Books for early Ethiopian readers. Over 12,000 copies have been distributed in Ethiopia. Now retired, widowed, and living in Oregon, Caroline returns regularly to Ethiopia where she continues development and consulting work, particularly in the area of solar energy. This is her debut book in the United States."I relished the introspective and lighthearted story telling by Caroline as she navigated the winding paths in her two very distinct worlds. [...] I was elated to find that her colorful journey and deliberation afforded her the best possible conclusion &#x2013; Ethiopia and America are indeed different but they may be the yin and yang that we all seek." &#x2015;<b>Dr. Woubeshet Ayenew</b>, Former Chairman of the Board, Ethiopian Community of Minnesota Organization (ECM)<br><br>"... a very interesting memoir worth sharing with a global audience.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>Dr. Worku L. Mulat</b>, President of Ethiopian Institute of Resilience and Climate Change Adaptation, honorary professor at Wollo University and research associate at The Tree Foundation.<br><br>"I finished this gripping story in a couple sittings because I wanted to know, badly, what would come of this remarkable girl raised on a ridge between two very different worlds. From the earliest age, Caroline Kurtz had to negotiate tensions between her parents&#x2019; driven idealism and the resolute traditionalism of peasants who still dressed in hand-woven shawls and plowed with oxen. This is a lyrical rendering of life lived on a fault-line between cultures, where accepted beliefs grind together and sometimes collapse.

(Come &amp; See) (The Come &amp; See Series)</h2><p>Do Catholics really read the Bible? If so, how do they read it and is there anything unique about their approach? What role does the Bible play in Catholic life, teaching, and culture?<br><br>As a leading Scripture scholar who also teaches students and preaches to everyday people, Fr. Daniel Harrington, S.J., has made it his life's mission to answer these and many related questions about the Bible and its relationship to Catholic life. Accessibly written, <i>How Do Catholics Read the Bible?</i> blends biblical scholarship with compelling personal anecdotes to equip readers with the tools they need to more fully engage Scripture and the Catholic tradition. With chapters on how the Catholic canon came to be, what the Church teaches about the Bible, appropriate methods for analyzing Scripture passages, and how to incorporate the Bible into everyday life, this book is ideal for individual or group use in parishes and classrooms. Each chapter concludes with questions for reflection and recommendations for further reading.</p><p>Daniel J. Harrington, SJ (1940&#x2013;2014), was a well-known expert on the Bible, a Jesuit priest, and professor of New Testament at the Boston College School of Theology and Ministry. His other books with Sheed &amp; Ward include Who is Jesus? Why is He Important?, Jesus and Virtue Ethics, and The Church According to the New Testament.A splendid companion to the Bible. A sure guide through issues that need to be understood if the reader is to appreciate how the Bible is 'the Word of God in human language.' (Emil A. Wcela, Auxiliary Bishop, Diocese of Rockville Centre and past President, Catholic Biblical Association)<br><br>Dan Harrington has the uncanny ability to make the complex, understandable and the profound, accessible to ordinary readers. In this volume, he brings together wise reflections on methods of interpreting Scripture today with examples from his own experience of interpreting Scripture for parish communities. <i>How do Catholics Read the Bible</i> is a reliable guide for every Catholic who has waited for a straightforward and clearly written introduction to reading the Bible in the Church today. (Barbara E. Bowe, R.S.C.J., Professor of Biblical Studies, Catholic Theological Union)<br><br>A superb synthesis of Catholic views on biblical interpretation, written by one of the church's best practitioners. (<i>The Bible Today</i>)<br><br>This volume, both concise and informative, constitutes a significant contribution to that pedogogical effort and is a splendid gift to general readers....In sum, both church and academy can welcome this book as a valuable <i>vade mecum</i> in biblical studies, as much for the informed access it provides to the thought of others as for Harrington's own exegesis. (Mark Kiley, April 2008 <i>H-Net: Humanities and Social Science Reviews Online</i>)<br><br>This little volume is both interesting and enlightening....This book gives good insight to Roman Catholic interpretation. (James R. Walker Ph.D, Director of Web-Based Education and Associate Professor, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary)<br><br>Harrington's book is a wonderfully clear, balanced, and accessible presentation of how the Catholic Church at its best understands and uses the Bible. This book should prove very helpful for a wide audience of Catholics and others who are interested in understanding the Bible in its historical contexts and, even more importantly, in their daily lives and in the life of the Church today. The book's style is always user-friendly. Harrington explains unfamiliar terms clearly and gives helpful examples of what he means. The book obviously reflects Harrington's thirty years of teaching, preaching, and praying over the biblical text. (Thomas H. Tobin, S.J., Professor of Theology, Loyola University Chicago)</p><h2>HCG Weight Loss Cure Guide: A Supplemental Guide to Dr. Simeons&#39; Pounds and Inches Supporting All Types of HCG</h2><p>Newest Revision 2012 - 5th Revision: The new 5th edition of the HCG Weight Loss Cure Guide has been completely rearranged to help HCG participants follow the information more easily.

So far, our record was five words in a row, which was pretty good, given that everyone here was only four and had the attention span of a gnat.</p><p>&#x201c;Theater,&#x201d; said Silvi.</p><p>Lissie, my assistant teacher, shot me a glance. Silvi was advanced, already reading. I felt a flash of pride for Clara, followed by the increasingly familiar buzz of nerves whenever anything related to Rafael entered my consciousness. For nearly five years, I&#x2019;d done a damn good job of keeping him out of my head.</p><p>&#x201c;Turd,&#x201d; said Geronimo, and the kids dissolved into giggles.</p><p>&#x201c;He said &#x2018;turd&#x2019;! He said &#x2018;turd&#x2019;! Turd!&#x201d; they shrieked. Axel got up and ran in a circle, a victory lap of sorts. Khaleesi started to cry, since she hated all things bowel-related, and Lissie comforted her.</p><p>&#x201c;We got up to six &#x2018;T&#x2019; words! That&#x2019;s a new record, so good work,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And, Geronimo, you&#x2019;re very funny, but let&#x2019;s keep bathroom talk for bathrooms and when you have to go, okay, sweetheart?&#x201d; I glanced at the clock. &#x201c;Great job, everyone. And look at the clock! It&#x2019;s time to clean up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Clean up, clean up, everybody clean up,&#x201d; the kids sang. We had a song for everything.</p><p>I directed the kids&#x2014;Khaleesi and Cash could put the stuffed animals away, Silvi and Wren could bring the paintbrushes to the sink, Dash and Roland would put pink reminder slips in everyone&#x2019;s cubby about bringing in special cuddle friends on Friday. Nash and Primrose reshelved books. I helped kids find their lunch boxes, gave out hugs, checked to see if paintings were dry enough to be taken home.</p><p>Then, at 2:00 on the dot, Lissie opened the door to let the parents in to get their kids. Donna, the teacher in room 2, let her kids out early every day&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she was one year away from retirement and really over teaching. The hallway was mobbed with kids and parents, and for a second, I didn&#x2019;t see him.</p><p>Then Silvi shouted, &#x201c;Uncle Rafe!&#x201d; and he knelt down, opening his arms as she ran to him.</p><p>My body reacted before my brain&#x2014;knees softened, my left leg wobbling, the instant heat in my stomach rising through my chest and neck into my face, my hands buzzing with adrenaline.</p><p>He was here.</p><p>Clara had put him on the authorized-pickup list. I&#x2019;d known this day was coming, but now that it was upon me, I couldn&#x2019;t seem to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what was the question again?</p><p>Rafe picked up his niece, kissed her on the cheek. &#x201c;Hello, sweet girl,&#x201d; he said, smiling.</p><p>Then he looked at me, and his eyes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I couldn&#x2019;t believe I&#x2019;d gone so long without seeing those eyes, so dark and beautiful, either the happiest or saddest eyes in the entire world, depending on his mood.</p><p>They were happy right now. Because of Silvi, of course.</p><p>He was clean-shaven now, and it made him look younger. My heart felt weak and thin.</p><p>&#x201c;Georgia,&#x201d; he said, and my stomach squeezed. His accent always made my name sound lush and delicious.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello, Rafe,&#x201d; I managed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s good to see you.&#x201d;</p><p>He was more beautiful than ever. Every one of his features was just a little big&#x2014;nose, mouth, eyes. Generous. His hair was shorter. No more ponytail, and he looked&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. perfect. But for some reason, his short hair and lack of a beard made me want to cry a little, because&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, because I hadn&#x2019;t known.</p><p>&#x201c;Miss Georgia, Miss Georgia, I can&#x2019;t find my sock!&#x201d; said Geronimo, who liked to strip down naked in the bathroom. And thank God, because it gave me an excuse to stop staring at my ex. I took Geronimo by the hand and led him to the bathroom, my heart banging. Never in my life was I so glad to close a door.</p><p>I took in a breath, then picked up the errant sock, which was lying under the sink. &#x201c;Here you go, honey. Remember what we said about keeping your clothes on in here? Just pull down your pants next time, okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay. I love you,&#x201d; he said, throwing his arms around my neck.</p><p>Maybe if I&#x2019;d been a preschool teacher when Rafe and I were married, we would&#x2019;ve made it.</p><p>Don&#x2019;t start, my brain said. You blew it. He asked for a divorce and you couldn&#x2019;t say yes fast enough.</p><p>I put on Geronimo&#x2019;s sock, tied his shoes and had him wash his hands. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my boy,&#x201d; I said, ruffling his hair.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re best friends,&#x201d; he told me.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice to have so many best friends, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; I asked. Couldn&#x2019;t have him thinking he was my favorite, even if he was in my top five.</p><p>When I came out, Geronimo&#x2019;s dad was waiting. &#x201c;How was my boy today?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He was excellent, as usual,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And very creative.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I said &#x2018;turd,&#x2019; Daddy! It starts with &#x2018;T&#x2019;!&#x201d;</p><p>The dad laughed. &#x201c;I guess it does. Thanks, Georgia. See you tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bye, gentlemen. Have a great afternoon.&#x201d;</p><p>Silvi was giving her uncle the tour. &#x201c;This is where we paint. This is where we read books. I have this book at home. I have this one, too. Read me this one, Uncle Rafe.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Silvi, let me talk to Miss Georgia a moment, sweetheart. We are old friends, did you know that?&#x201d;</p><p>My heart rate tripled.</p><p>&#x201c;You are?&#x201d; Silvi asked. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a pleasant surprise!&#x201d;</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t help a smile. Silvi&#x2019;s vocabulary was rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll.</p><p>&#x201c;We are.&#x201d; His hand rested on her head. &#x201c;Can you look at a book by yourself for a moment, sweet one?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Silvi loves books, don&#x2019;t you, honey?&#x201d; Which he probably knew, being her uncle and all that.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I do,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I can read some by myself.&#x201d;</p><p>My hands were shaking, so I stuck them in the pockets of my denim jumper (which was just as sexy as it sounded).</p><p>Rafe came over and stood in front of me, and my heart wasn&#x2019;t just pounding now, but thrumming. The poker in my stomach twisted again and again.</p><p>&#x201c;Small world,&#x201d; I said, my voice quiet.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. How have you been, Georgia?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Great. Fine. I&#x2019;m preschool teacher now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So I heard.&#x201d; A dark eyebrow lifted.</p><p>&#x201c;I heard you have a new restaurant. Um&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Cherish told me. My stepmother? Remember her?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I remember her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure. Why wouldn&#x2019;t you? I mean, how many people are named Cherish, right? Let alone exotic dancer stepmoms, right? Anyway, she said that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that she went to your restaurant. And it was good.&#x201d;</p><p>Rafe didn&#x2019;t answer for a minute. Why would he? I was babbling like an idiot. I tried to look at him and failed.</p><p>&#x201c;Silvi says she loves school,&#x201d; he said finally. &#x201c;Thank you for that. The move, it was a little difficult for her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s doing great here.&#x201d; I drew in a shaky breath. &#x201c;How are you, Rafael?&#x201d; Forced myself to look at him.</p><p>His expression was neutral. I had no idea what mine was. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing very well, thank you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I hope it will not be too awkward, us seeing each other from time to time.&#x201d;</p><p>Awkward? Not at all. Agonizing, that was a better word.</p><p>&#x201c;No. It&#x2019;s fine. Don&#x2019;t worry about me! I&#x2019;m&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#x2019;m great. With this, I mean. It&#x2019;s lovely to see you again. Lovely to have Silvi. That&#x2019;s what I meant.&#x201d;</p><p>He just kept looking at me.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you seeing anyone?&#x201d; I asked, then jerked back a little because I hadn&#x2019;t meant to ask.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I am.&#x201d;</p><p>Of course he was. &#x201c;And is she&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is she nice?&#x201d; Is she beautiful? Is she kind? Is she thin? Do you love her?</p><p>My ex-husband didn&#x2019;t answer immediately. The silence swelled. Then he said, &#x201c;I would rather not discuss her. But yes. She is nice.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded, my face burning. &#x201c;Well. Congratulations on the new restaurant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Uncle Rafe?&#x201d;</p><p>This time, the voice was deeper. We both turned, and there was Mason.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Rafe said, his eyes widening in surprise. &#x201c;It cannot be. Mason? Oh, madre de Dios, Mason! Where is the boy? You are a young man now! Come! Give me a hug!&#x201d;</p><p>There it was, that magical ease and warmth he had with people. Mason obeyed happily, and I swallowed against the wedge in my throat.</p><p>Mason had been our ring bearer.</p><p>The two of them were chatting away like long-lost friends, which I guessed they were.</p><p>That was the shitty thing about divorce. You lost that whole other family, that whole world. Rafe had been so good for Mason, his gentle brand of masculinity a much better role model than Hunter&#x2019;s seething, omnipresent hostility.</p><p>Maybe if Rafe had been in the picture, Mason wouldn&#x2019;t have done what he did this past April.</p><p>&#x201c;Mason, please, come meet my niece, Silvi. She is a student here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cool. Hey, little kid. I&#x2019;m Mason.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not little. I&#x2019;m almost a big sister,&#x201d; Silvi said.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, gotcha. Sorry.&#x201d; Mason grinned at us.</p><p>&#x201c;I forgive you,&#x201d; she said sweetly.</p><p>&#x201c;Silvi, we should go,&#x201d; Rafe said. &#x201c;I have to work tonight, and I want to take you to the park and perhaps for some ice cream, what do you say?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I say yes!&#x201d; Silvi got up, hugged my legs, then grabbed her uncle&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Bye, Miss Georgia,&#x201d; she sang out.</p><p>&#x201c;It was good to see you,&#x201d; Rafe said. Probably a lie.</p><p>Then they were gone.</p></p><h2>The Complete Guide to Service Learning: Proven, Practical Ways to Engage Students in Civic Responsibility, Academic Curriculum, &amp; Social Action (Free Spirit Professional&#x2122;)</h2><p>Book with CD-RomThe Complete Guide to Service Learning is the go-to resource in the fast-growing field of service learning.

The year was 1826, and the giraffe belonged to the pasha of Egypt, who decided to give her as a gift to the king of France. The giraffe journeyed first by boat to Marseilles, then on foot through the towns and villages of France, all the way to Paris. Her arrival in the capital was celebrated with a splendid royal parade, and everywhere she went she caused a sensation. First published in 1992.</p><p>Roger Roth, Sr., has partnered with Dr. Hanby in his ministry and writing for many years. Together they oversee Mark Hanby Ministries/Fathers Heart Ministries, an internationally recognized teaching and resource center.Grade 1-3-- Although this resembles a picture book, it is actually, and surprisingly, nonfiction. In an attempt to improve relations between Egypt and France, who were on opposite sides of the Greek war of independence in the 1820s, the pasha of Egypt presented King Charles X with a giraffe, the first in Europe in over three centuries. But in the days before aircraft, how do you send a large, ungainly animal such a long way? The answer is depicted in this book--a sea : voyage to Marseilles, and then a six-week march to Paris. The brief text is written in a chatty style that deals effectively with the logistics of the move and its historical underpinnings. It also includes details that will appeal to young readers: the custom-made giraffe raincoat necessitated by France's cooler climate, the need for a cow in the entourage to provide La Girafe's daily rations, the unusual way a giraffe moves its legs in walking. The illustrations are attractive pastel cartoons and one full-color photograph of the giraffe's stuffed remains, still on display at La Rochelle. The book concludes with a historical note briefly outlining the background of the story. A charming illumination of one of history's more obscure footnotes. --Barbara Hutcheson, Greater Victoria Public Library, B.C., Canada<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>National Geographic Birding Essentials: All the Tools, Techniques, and Tips You Need to Begin and Become a Better Birder</h2><p>Birding is the fastest growing wildlife-related outdoor activity in the U.S., with at least a million new birders a year estimated to join an already robust group some 80 million strong. For these beginning and intermediate enthusiasts, <i>National Geographic Birding Essentials</i> is a must. Comprehensive and authoritative, yet engaging and user-friendly, it teaches readers how to begin and improve their birding... what to look and listen for... and how to make sense of what they see and hear. A unique visual component shows actual field guide pages and how to read them, while another compares the same bird in photography versus artwork and explains how to use both for species identification. National Geographic's quality photography is a major highlight of the book, supplemented by pencil drawings and full-color maps to give the novice and intermediate birder a full range of visual information. <br><br>Field Ornithologists Jonathan Alderfer and Jon Dunn have crafted a masterful guide, striking just the right balance of practical information and reader-friendly tone. Chapters discuss the pleasures of birding, equipment needed, how to read range maps, birds' physical features, how to identify birds, identification challenges, bird classification and suggested books and journals for building a fine birding library. <br><br>National Geographic has established a stellar reputation among birders with our blockbuster <i>Field Guide to the Birds of North America.</i> The tradition continues as we serve an entry-level market that continually needs the helpful, up-to-the-minute information found in <i>National Geographic Birding Essentials.</i></p><p>Jonathan Alderfer is chief consultant for the National Geographic Birding Program and a widely published author and field guide illustrator.

Exhausted from your armchair travels to Paris? Despairing of ever finding a place that speaks to you beyond reason? You are ripe for a journey to Brittany, where author Mark Greenside reluctantly travels, eats of the cr�pes, and finds a second life. <br> <br> When Mark Greenside -- a native New Yorker living in California, doubting (not-as-trusting-as Thomas, downwardly mobile, political lefty, writer, and lifelong skeptic -- is dragged by his girlfriend to a tiny Celtic village in Brittany at the westernmost edge of France, in Finist�re, "the end of the world," his life begins to change. <br> <br> In a playful, headlong style, and with enormous affection for the Bretons, Greenside tells how he makes a life for himself in a country where he doesn't speak the language or know how things are done. Against his personal inclinations and better judgments, he places his trust in the villagers he encounters -- neighbors, workers, acquaintances -- and is consistently won over and surprised as he manages and survives day-to-day trials: from opening a bank account and buying a house to removing a beehive from the chimney -- in other words, learning the cultural ropes, living with neighbors, and making new friends. <br> <br> <i>I'll Never Be French (no matter what I do)</i> is a beginning and a homecoming for Greenside, as his father's family emigrated from France. It is a memoir about fitting in, not standing out; being part of something larger, not being separate from it; following, not leading. It explores the joys and adventures of living a double life.</p><p><b>Mark Greenside</b> holds B.S. and M.A. degrees from the University of Wisconsin. He has been a civil rights activist, Vietnam War protestor, anti-draft counselor, Vista Volunteer, union leader, and college professor. His stories have appeared in <i>The Sun</i>, <i>The Literary Review</i>, <i>Cimarron Review</i>, <i>The Nebraska Review</i>, <i>Beloit Fiction Journal</i>, <i>The New Laurel Review</i>, <i>Crosscurrents</i>, <i>Five Fingers Review</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Long Story</i>, as well as other journals and magazines, and he&nbsp;is the author of the short story collection, <i>I Saw a Man Hit His Wife</i>.<br><br>He presently lives in Alameda, California, where he continues to teach and be politically active, and Brittany, France, where he still can&#x2019;t do anything without asking for help.<p><b>Getting There</b></p><p>It begins with a girl. It always begins with a girl, and even though we don't make it through the summer -- through even <i>half</i> the summer -- she gets me there and changes my life. It doesn't matter what happened or why, it's one of the best gifts I've ever been given.</p><p>It happened like this.</p><p>It's 1991 and I'm in her apartment, living her third of our bicoastal relationship (one-third in New York, one-third in California, one-third apart), probably the only person in Manhattan looking forward to a summer in the city, when she says, "Honey, let's go to France."</p><p>I close my book and listen, petrified. I hate to fly and don't speak French. This isn't a good idea. I was in Paris in 1966, and they loathed me, and I don't think I've changed that much. "Let's go to Saskatchewan."</p><p>"It's not the same."</p><p>"I know. They speak English and we can drive."</p><p>"Don't worry. I'll take care of everything."</p><p>It's late May, a beautiful spring in New York, and this is her busiest time at work. As far as I can see, there's no need to start studying French.</p><p>That's my second mistake.</p><p>One week later, she announces she's found the perfect place. "It's special, magical, enchanted." She's a poet. Everything she says is exaggerated.</p><p>"Where?" I ask, thinking Paris, Nice, Cannes, Antibes.</p><p>"Brittany. It's as far west as you can go. Finist�re."</p><p>"What does that mean?"</p><p>"The end of the world."</p><p><i>That's</i> when I panic. I go to the bookstore and read in a guidebook that Bretons aren't French but Celtic -- linked by language and culture to the Irish, Scots, Cornish, and Welsh -- so maybe I do have a chance. On the other hand, they've been French since 1532, why chance it? I go to the Caf� des Artistes and write her a note. "Great work. Could you ask if the place is on-a-country-road quiet, sunny, and large? Does it have a good bed, hard mattress, running water, hot running water [remembering my stay in Paris], a TV, stereo, car, separate studies for writing, a coffeemaker, shower, bath, at least two floors, farm animals in the vicinity, a washing machine, dryer, and dishwasher, a bar in the village, a boulangerie, a market, a post office, bikes, and neighbors who want Americans living next door?" I leave it on her desk, thinking, Saskatchewan, here we come.</p><p>The next day she leaves me a message on her answering machine. "We have it -- a thousand a month, with a car."</p><p>I wait a minute, put on my happy voice, and call her at work. "Hi...got your message."</p><p>"Ouiiiiiii," she sings.</p><p>"Does it have all those things I asked about?</p><p>"Certainement. The last thing I need is to listen to you complaining every day."</p><p>"It <i>really</i> has all those things?"</p><p>"That's what the lady said. Her name's Sally. She's English and just returned from the house. She lives in Massachusetts, you can ask her yourself."</p><p>So I do. I call her, and she says yes to everything. There's no way out. I'm going to France.<br></p><p>We book our flight on Air France. All I can think of is a joke I recently heard. "In Heaven, the French are the cooks, Italians are the lovers, English are the police, Swiss are the managers, and Germans are the engineers. In Hell, the English are the cooks, Swiss are the lovers, Italians are the engineers, Germans are the police, and the French are the managers." I know I'm going to die -- but if I do, I'm going in comfort and style. The food on the flight is scrumptious, and we're flying economy. The meal begins with a printed menu and a choice ofboeuf Bourguignon or filet de sole bonne femme. The wine is French -- C�te du Rh�ne, Burgundy, Beaujolais -- and is good and free and limitless. The front of the menu has a lovely little poem by La Fontaine. Mine is "Lion." Hers is "Swan." I look around and see four other poems. Everything about this is class. <i>Joie de vivre, savoir-faire, je ne sais quoi</i>. The movies, the nibbles and snacks, the pampering. If this is France, this is going to be all right, I think -- until we get to the baggage claim, which brings me back to the joke.</p><p>The flight was wonderful, the landing superb. We took off and landed on time. The stewards and stewardesses were everything you'd want them to be in appearance, demeanor, humor, efficiency. I've slept. I'm full. I'm in Paris. I have everything I need -- except my luggage. The good news is, nobody else has theirs either. The worst news is, an hour and a half later, it's still the same. Six and a half hours of relaxing comfort and pleasure getting here, and an hour and a half of standing up, nowhere to go, sit, eat, rest, drink, or relax.</p><p>It's baffling. Everything about Charles de Gaulle Airport is space-age, high-tech modern: tubes, lights, tunnels; escalators running up, down, sideways. The French love gadgets and gadgetry (think guillotine), and everything that can be is automated, everything except labor.</p><p>Two and a half hours later -- 9:30 on the dot -- we're on the bus to Paris. We sit in the seat directly behind the driver. Kathryn takes the window and spends the next hour oohing and aaahing over the architecture and skyline. I spend it in awe of the driver, watching him alternately race to 130 kilometers per hour, then slow down to 30, only to race back to 130 and never once move more than eighteen inches away from the vehicle directly in front of us. He does this for fifty minutes, all the way from Charles de Gaulle A�roport to downtown Paris, where he stops in front of a brasserie.</p><p>"Let's go," Kathryn says.</p><p>"Go where?"</p><p>"To the station."</p><p>For some reason -- and I'm sure there is one, because there always is one, a reason, or rule, or <i>normalement</i> -- the bus stop is across the street from the train station. Across two big busy streets in a city and a country not known for its kind, safe, considerate, California, pedestrian-has-the-right-of-way drivers. A phalanx of cars and trucks whizzes by and shakes the bus.</p><p>"Let's wait," I say.</p><p>"For what? This is the stop. Let's go." She pulls my hand. </p><p>I hesitate, then leap and run to the doorway of the brasserie to wait.</p><p>When everybody is off the bus and milling about, the driver pushes himself out of his seat, lumbers to the side of the bus, raises the panels, and lugubriously begins unloading the luggage. He does it with the seriousness and concentration of a brain surgeon. It's then that I notice his uniform bears no name. No "Hi, I'm Jacques, I'm your driver for the day." No "My name's Pierre. If I drive like a maniac or smash your bag, here's how you can report me." This bothers me, because in a second or two, whatever his name, he's going to hate us.</p><p>Everyone else's bags are relatively small and lightweight, but we're writers and staying for the summer. Between us we have nine heavy bags and two luggage carts. I have a computer. She has a typewriter. We each have a bag filled with books and another with files and notebooks and paper. She has lots and lots of shoes and clothes, something for any occasion. I have three bottles of twelve-year-old Macallan and a jacket and shoes for every kind of weather from blizzards and hurricanes to drought. The driver doesn't know any of this because someone else loaded the bags at the airport. Now, as he pulls them out, he begins to grumble. The fourth bag he yanks and drops on the sidewalk. The fifth he tosses at me. The sixth he throws. The seventh is Kathryn's typewriter. She taps him on the arm and tells him in flawless French that she's a poet and that's her typewriter and asks him to please be careful. He lifts it and puts it down gently, as gently as if it were a quail's egg, the last quail's egg in the world and he's the hungriest man alive. Then he starts talking to her about poetry, quoting Verlaine, Rimbaud, Baudelaire, and Poe, while I crawl into the luggage bin and tear my pants as I get my computer. When he finally finishes cooing and leaves, she's beaming. "La belle France, la belle France. <i>That's</i> why I love it here."</p><p>That's also when it starts to rain.</p><p>She unzips her backpack and removes an umbrella. I'm amazed and delighted by her forethought. My rain gear is all packed on the bottom of the one bag I have that isn't waterproof. I wait in grateful anticipation as she unsheathes her umbrella and opens it. It's Barbie's umbrella. Thumbelina's. The tiniest little umbrella in the universe. An umbrella for one. I wipe the water from my glasses and glare at her.</p><p>She shrugs.</p><p>I gather our bags as quickly as I can, balance and tie them to our luggage carts, and wait for a lull in the traffic. There is none. You'd think with the rain coming down harder and us standing there getting wet, someone might slow down. Not a chance. The morning Paris commute is a crazed Le Mans. I'm astonished. Can these be the same people who took two and a half hours to unload our bags?</p><p>Kathryn takes two steps into the street. I watch, as miraculously one car stops, then another, and another, and another. It's like royalty entering a room. The stillness is almost palpable. I follow in her wake through the traffic, across the streets, all the way into Gare Montparnasse, feeling unbeatable, like Napoleon must have felt just before Waterloo.</p><p>Gare Montparnasse is huge, gargantuan, signifying grandeur, power, control, direction, order, authority, a plan. The first floor, the one we're standing on, is a big wide-open space. In the middle of this space, slowly, inexorably, moving up and down, is a bank of escalators. On either side of the escalators are stairs.</p><p>I push my luggage cart around in ever-widening circles, looking for the elevator.</p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p>"Looking for the elevator."</p><p>"I don't think there is one. I'll ask."</p><p>How can that be? This is a train station. A huge modern train station, the point of departure for all points west in France. How could old people, disabled people, people in wheelchairs, people carrying five heavy bags of luggage like me, get from this floor to the next without an elevator?</p><p>"Nope. No elevator. We have to take the escalator or the stairs."</p><p>"Ask someone else. A woman this time -- an old one."</p><p>She glares at me, but she does it. She finds t...</p></p><h2>Women Without Men: A Novel of Modern Iran</h2><p>"Using the techniques of both the fabulist and the polemicist, Parsipur continues her protest against traditional Persian gender relations in this charming, powerful novella." &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>This modern literary masterpiece follows the interwoven destinies of five women&#x2014;including a wealthy middle-aged housewife, a prostitute, and a schoolteacher&#x2014;as they arrive by different paths to live together in an abundant garden on the outskirts of Tehran. Drawing on elements of Islamic mysticism and recent Iranian history, this unforgettable novel depicts women escaping the narrow confines of family and society, and imagines their future living in a world without men.</p><p>Born in Iran in 1946, <b>Shahrnush Parsipur</b> began her career as a fiction writer and producer at Iranian National Television and Radio. She was imprisoned for nearly five years by the Islamist government without being formally charged. Shortly after her release, she published <i>Women Without Men</i> and was arrested and jailed again, this time for her frank and defiant portrayal of women's sexuality. While still banned in Iran, the novel became an underground bestseller there, and has been translated into many languages around the world. She is also the author of <i>Touba and the Meaning of Night</i>, among many other books, and now lives in exile in Northern California.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Persian</p><h2>Black Imagination: Black Voices on Black Futures</h2><p>"Close your eyes--make the white gaze disappear." What is it like to be black and joyful, without submitting to the white gaze? This question, and its answer, is at the core of <i>Black Imagination</i>, a dynamic collection collection curated by artist and poet Natasha Marin. Born from a series of exhibitions and fueled by the power of social media (#blackimagination), the collection includes work from a range of voices who offer up powerful individual visions of happiness and safety, rituals and healing. Black Imagination presents an opportunity to understand the joy of blackness without the lens of whiteness.</p><p><p><strong>Natasha Marin</strong> is a conceptual artist whose people-centered projects have circled the globe and have been recognized and acknowledged by Art Forum, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the LA Times, and others. In 2018, Marin manifested BLACK IMAGINATION: The States of Matter, The (g)Listening, and Ritual Objects-- a triptych of audio-based, conceptual art exhibitions in and around Seattle, WA. BLACK IMAGINATION is community-based, ongoing and continues to amplify, center, and hold sacred a diverse sample of Black voices including LGBTQIA+ black youth, incarcerated black women, black folks with disabilities, unsheltered black folks, and black children. Marin's viral web-based project, Reparations, engaged a quarter of a million people worldwide in the practice of "leveraging privilege," and earned Marin, a mother of two, death threats by the dozens.

But what does that title mean and what do these women mean for us today?<br><br> Elizabeth Dreyer examines the history-changing effect each of their unique theologies have had on our Church and our world. She explains how our understanding of the cross, the incarnation of the Holy Spirit, and the human person have been enhanced by the work of these women. They may not have planned to be thought of as theologians, but reading about their lives, teaching, and writings will have a profound effect on how you live your faith.&nbsp;</p><p>Elizabeth A. Dreyer is professor emerita of Religious Studies at Fairfield University in Fairfield, Connecticut, and an adjunct professor at the Hartford Seminary in Hartford, Connecticut. She is the author or editor of nine books, including <i>Making Sense of God: A Woman&#x2019;s Perspective</i>, and has written extensively on topics such as medieval theology and spirituality, women&#x2019;s spirituality, theology of grace, the Holy Spirit, and contemporary lay spirituality. Dreyer holds a doctorate in historical theology from Marquette University, and has done graduate work at Harvard Divinity School and the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies at the University of St. Michael's, Toronto, Canada.</p><h2>Marisol and Other Plays</h2><p>First major collection by a leading Hispanic-American playwright.</p><p>There was a period in the early 1990s when the Magic Realism of Jorge Luis Borges and the South American writers seemed to erupt into American theater like an exotic tropical flower taking over a wood lot. It also was the era of angels, which came to a climax in Tony Kushner's <i>Angels in America.</i> But the two trends intersected most gaudily in Jose Rivera's <i>Marisol,</i> the story of a young woman living in a terrifying inner-city wasteland who tries to maintain her faith that her Guardian Angel is protecting her. But one day her Guardian Angel appears with bad news. The angels are revolting against God, and Marisol will henceforth be on her own. This sets Marisol off on a surreal journey to find security and faith in a world bereft of either. A fascinating black fairy tale.

Kelly&#x2019;s actions and their consequences, a reckoning two decades in the making</b><br> &nbsp;<br> In November 2000, Chicago journalist and music critic Jim DeRogatis received an anonymous fax that alleged R. Kelly had a problem with &#x201c;young girls.&#x201d; Weeks later, DeRogatis broke the shocking story, publishing allegations that the R&amp;B superstar and local hero had groomed girls, sexually abused them, and paid them off. DeRogatis thought his work would have an impact. Instead, Kelly&#x2019;s career flourished.<br><br> No one seemed to care: not the music industry, not the culture at large, not the parents of numerous other young girls. But for more than eighteen years, DeRogatis stayed on the story. He was the one who was given the disturbing videotape that led to Kelly&#x2019;s 2008 child pornography trial, the one whose window was shot out, and the one whom women trusted to tell their stories&#x2014;of a meeting with the superstar at a classroom, a mall, a concert, or a McDonald&#x2019;s that forever warped the course of their lives.<br><br><i>Soulless: The Case Against R. Kelly</i>&nbsp;is DeRogatis&#x2019;s masterpiece, a work of tenacious journalism and powerful cultural criticism. It tells the story of Kelly&#x2019;s career, DeRogatis&#x2019;s investigations, and the world in which the two crossed paths, and brings the story up to the moment when things finally seem to have changed. Decades in the making, this is an outrageous, darkly riveting account of the life and actions of R.

And from the depictions we&#39;ve seen-monks sitting on meditation cushions, nuns kneeling in prayer, shamans communing with the universe-it seems that this elusive state is reserved for a chosen few. But now, neuroscientist David Perlmutter and medical anthropologist and shaman Alberto Villoldo have come together to explore the commonalities between their specialties with the aim of making enlightenment possible for anyone.Joining the long-separated worlds of science and spirit, Perlmutter explores the exciting phenomena of neurogenesis and mitochondrial health, while Villoldo brings his vast knowledge of shamanic and spiritual practices to the table. Together they draw from the most powerful tools in each discipline to create the Power Up Your Brain program, a ground-breaking, five-week plan that helps prime the brain for enlightenment. With nutritional advice, dietary supplements, physical exercise, shamanic practices, meditation, and visualizations, Perlmutter and Villoldo guide readers, step by step, through a program to help them clear their minds from previous trauma and open themselves up to experience the inner peace, vast insight, and extraordinary creativity that define the experience of enlightenment, paving the way to successfully face the challenges to come.</p><p>David Perlmutter, M.D., FACN, is a board-certified neurologist and fellow of the American College of Nutrition.

Finally Alive, by John Piper, fulfills that need admirably. In his book, Piper explains just what it means to be born again, and shows how the scriptural teaching on that subject is designed to give all glory to God, and to cast us in utter dependence upon him." </p> (Nathan Pitchford Reformed Books.Net)<br><br><p>"Theologically thorough and yet heart-warmingly pastoral and practical, this important book should help God's people to value the remarkable status and responsibility of being &#x2018;born again.'"</p> (Richard Cunningham, Director of Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship (UCCF), United Kingdom)<br><br><p>... simply terrific.

Because no issue could be more critical, I believe this is the most important book Piper has written."</p> (Adrian Warnock, blogger)<br><br><p>"Expository and practical, this rich survey of New Testament teaching explores the nature of the new birth and the life which flows from it.

Such concepts are not always easy to accept, but, as Elder Maxwell observes, &#34;the hardness is usually not in their complexity, but in the deep demands these doctrines make on us.&#34; All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience focuses on some of the &#34;hard doctrines&#34; that members of the Church must grapple with in the latter days. This book will help the Saints prepare for the trials ahead, while assuring them that the power of God&#39;s love is constantly available to the faithful.</p><p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell, who previously served as executive vice president at the University of Utah and as Commissioner of Education for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, was sustained as an Assistant to the Twelve in 1974 and called to the Quorum of the Twelve in 1981. A beloved speaker and author, he wrote more than twenty-five books, including The Enoch Letters; Moving in His Majesty and Power; The Promise of Discipleship; and Not My Will, but Thine. Elder Maxwell passed away in 2004.

Easy to make flowers that match your handmade outfits. * Karen Platt- yarnsandfabrics.co.uk * Kanzashi flowers are those beautiful fabric flowers associated with traditional Japanese hairstyles, especially those of geishas. They are not hard to make, and can be used to adorn more than hair decorations; they are also a great way of using up oddments of fabric. This book, translated from the French shows you how to make both the styles with just fabric, and those using the plastic Clover Flower Makers. There are sixteen different flowers to choose from, plus the more Western yoyo (aka Suffolk puff), rosette and padded &#34;pumpkin&#34; shape reminiscent of pincushions. Each flower has a series of captioned diagrams that are well laid out on the page but would be even better if they were all in a dark line color rather than red, pink or orange. There is a handy gallery of all the finished types, and then it is on with the projects. All these are illustrated with large photographs, often giving more than one view of the finished piece and separate parts. The print is quite small, and instructions don&#39;t always feature staged diagrams so some sewing experience is essential for the more challenging projects. You won&#39;t find any Japanese style hair decorations in here and the hanging &#34;falls&#34; are omitted, but instead there are many ingenious ways of using the flowers to decorate all kinds of other things. These are beautiful and unusual - waterlily table decorations, lots of jewelry, Christmas decorations, Peter Pan collar with flower and a crafter&#39;s bag to name some.

For the full review and images please visit: www.crochetaddictuk.com * Crochet Addict UK * Kanzashi flowers are a traditional Japanese craft originally used as a hair ornament. In this collection, French costume designer Blondeau presents the basics of kanzashi making, including designs ranging from simple to complex. Basic kanzashi flowers require simple supplies that most sewists will have on hand-fabric scraps (medium-weight fabrics such as cotton poplin or raw silk are ideal), fabric glue, and a hand sewing kit. As the flowers become more complex, kanzashi flower makers, which are plastic templates in five different shapes corresponding to a specific petal type, are used. Flowers can be finished with beads or buttons and incorporated into numerous projects, including jewelry or handbags, or used as an embellishment or an accessory. Step-by-step directions for sewing 16 different kanzashi are provided; 12 projects supply ideas for using the finished flowers as well as further variations. VERDICT Crafters with an interest in embellishment or in traditional Japanese crafts will enjoy this collection. * Library Journal USA *</p><h2>Teaching Mathematics in the Visible Learning Classroom, High School (Corwin Mathematics Series)</h2><p><p><strong>Select the right task, at the right time, for the right phase of learning</strong></p> <p>How do you generate that lightbulb "aha" moment of understanding for your students?

What he has learned has required him to rethink many of his previous assumptions.<br><br><i>Israel Matters</i> addresses the perennially important issue of the relationship between Christianity and the people and land of Israel, offering a unique and compelling "third way" between typical approaches and correcting common misunderstandings along the way. This book challenges the widespread Christian assumption that since Jesus came to earth, Jews are no longer special to God as a people, and the land of Israel is no longer theologically significant. It traces the author's journey from thinking those things to discovering that the New Testament authors believed the opposite of both. It also shows that contrary to what many Christians believe, the church is not the new Israel, and both the people and the land of Israel are important to God and the future of redemption.<br><br>McDermott offers an accessible but robust defense of a "New Christian Zionism" for pastors and laypeople interested in Israel and Christian-Jewish relations. His approach will also spark a conversation among theologians and biblical scholars.</p><p>"On one hand of the Protestant ecumene, the ideological captivities of once 'mainline' churches prevent understanding of the unique calling of the Jews and the role therein of the land. On the other hand, dispensationalist evangelicalism has a place for them, in a scheme other Christians must judge a bizarre perversion of Scripture. This book could be a historic breakthrough."<br>--<b>Robert&nbsp;W. Jenson</b>, Center of Theological Inquiry<br><br>"It is a pleasure to commend this discussion of the relationship between the church and the people and land of Israel. McDermott's voice is a crucial one as he shows how this theme is neither new nor tied to one particular Christian tradition. This book, dealing with a topic that often is treated too simplistically by both sides in the debate, will be of great value to the church."<br>--<b>Darrell&nbsp;L. Bock</b>, Dallas Theological Seminary<br><br>"McDermott offers a balanced interpretation of Christian theological tradition regarding Judaism and a close reading of the Bible that both strengthens Christian belief and makes room for the Jewish people in their covenantal homeland. A must-read for all people of faith."<br>--<b>Rabbi Dr. Eugene Korn</b>, Center for Jewish-Christian Understanding and Cooperation, Israel<br><br>"Wary of uncritical, dispensationalist Zionism and hypercritical anti-Zionism alike, McDermott examines with skill and intelligence a multitude of complex biblical texts, historical developments, political realities, and theological quandaries. He channels these insights into a coherent and forceful argument on behalf of a radical claim that the Church has too long evaded--that Israel, in all its dimensions, is an essential component of God's redemptive purpose in history."<br>--<b>Mark S. Kinzer</b>, author of <i>Postmissionary Messianic Judaism: Redefining Christian Engagement with the Jewish People</i><br><br>"Not content to take on supersessionism, McDermott reworks covenantal theology to argue that there remains a covenant with Israel, which includes the land, and that this insight has implications for Christian doctrine as a whole. He eschews a starry-eyed vision of the current State of Israel, preferring to acknowledge its mistakes while also recognizing its importance in history. McDermott has placed Christian Zionism on firm biblical and theological footing. I heartily recommend this book."<br>--<b>Dale Coulter</b>, Regent University<br><br>"Every theologian--and especially those theologians who might be inclined to disagree--should read <i>Israel Matters</i>, as it is destined to become the standard text for this perspective.

In his trademark journalist style, author William Bolitho details the lives of twelve great adventurers&#x2015;Alexander the Great, Casanova, Christopher Columbus, Mahomet, Lola Montez, Cagliostro (and Seraphina), Charles XII of Sweden, Napoleon I, Lucius Sergius Catiline, Napoleon III, Isadora Duncan, and Woodrow Wilson. Bolitho shines light on both the struggles and successes that made these figures so iconic, and demonstrates how they all battled convention and conformity to achieve enduring fame and notoriety.<br><br> &#x201c;We are born adventurers,&#x201d; Bolitho writes, &#x201c;and the love of adventures never leaves us till we are very old; old, timid men, in whose interest it is that adventure should quite die out. This is why all the poets are on one side, and all the laws on the other; for laws are made by, and usually for, old men." Though his essays are nearly one hundred years old, they encompass the timeless values of perseverance, bravery, and strength of spirit that have proven to resonate with the pioneers and thought leaders of today.</p><p>William Bolitho Ryall (1891&#x2013;1930), aka William Bolitho, was a South African journalist and writer who was a valued friend of the eminent writers Ernest Hemingway and No�l Coward."<i>Twelve Against the Gods</i> provides an interesting perspective on what drove and impeded this group of adventurers. It's a good read for anyone who's interested in history or looking to find some motivation to switch things up and break the rules ... Taking some time to read about Bolitho's thoughts on promise, risk, and success is definitely worthwhile." -�ine Cain, <i>Business Insider</i><br><br>"I think <i>Twelve Against the Gods</i> is also very appropriate for this day and age.

Campbell argues that the community of metropolitan Richmond is engaged in a decisive spiritual battle in the coming decade. He believes the city, more than any in the nation, has the potential for an unprecedented and historic achievement. Its citizens can redeem and fulfill the ideals of their ancestors, proving to the world that race and class can be conquered by the deliberate and prayerful intention of honest and dedicated citizens.</p><p>A native of Arlington, Virginia, the Rev. Benjamin P. Campbell studied political science and political economy at Williams College in Massachusetts, and studied theology as a Rhodes Scholar at the Queen&#39;s College in Oxford. He received a Master s in Divinity and an honorary Doctorate in Divinity from the Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria. He was ordained to the priesthood of the Episcopal Church in 1966. He came to Richmond in 1970 and has lived in Church Hill since that time. He has ministered to three Episcopal churches, and served as Communications Director and subsequently Program Director of the Episcopal Diocese of Virginia. He directed two non-profit corporations the Richmond Urban Institute, and Home Base, Incorporated, a neighborhood-based low-income housing corporation. In 1987, he became Pastoral Director of Richmond Hill, an ecumenical Christian community and retreat center on Church Hill in Richmond. He is a co-founder of the Micah Association, which links more than 100 faith communities to twenty-five inner city elementary schools in Richmond, and of the Armstrong Leadership Program, involving thirty-six students in Richmond s inner city Armstrong High School. He chairs the program committee of Communities in Schools, a program that supports volunteer efforts and social service work in the Richmond Public Schools. He is also a member of the Richmond Slave Trail Commission and the Richmond Public Schools Foundation. Dr. Campbell is a member of the Residential Community at Richmond Hill. He is married to the former Ann Elizabeth Hopkins, a teacher at William Fox Elementary School in the City of Richmond. Their children attended and graduated from Richmond Public Schools. Dr. Campbell is a seventh generation Virginian. His Scots-Irish ancestors first came to Berkeley Springs in the 1760s, and settled at Timber Ridge, in Rockbridge County outside of Lexington, in the 1780s.In these powerful and eloquent pages, Ben Campbell reveals a complicated history that has been hidden in plain sight. Campbell, long a brave and wise leader in Richmond, allows us to see an important and emblematic American city with new eyes. Though writing here as a historian, Campbell writes for the future, for the healing that is yet to come. --Edward L. Ayers, President, University of Richmond<br><br>Ben Campbell s book is an insightful and factual treatment of Richmond's history during the first four centuries of the city s existence. It is a must read that captures the spirit of conflict, rebellion and change from several perspectives. History aficionados will appreciate this timely book as Virginia commemorates the sesquicentennial of the Civil War. --Senator Henry L. Marsh, III<br><br>The history of Richmond, Virginia, encapsulates the history of the nation itself. For that reason, Richmond's story, or parts of it, has been the subject of hundreds of books, articles, and scholarly papers. Yet, no one has examined this history through the lens of Christian ethics--at least, not until Episcopalian priest, the Reverend Benjamin Campbell. Writing as a local pastor, theologian, and modern-day prophet, he exposes the ugly truth of Richmond s past and how the injustices of earlier periods haunt metropolitan Richmond today. Yet, he argues, what better place than Richmond for those unaware of the truth, those scarred by it, and those who deny it to listen to each other and engage in an honest conversation about the past and the inequities that divide the city today. Could not Richmond, Campbell asks, model for the rest of the country how truth-telling can lead to redemption and reconciliation? This is a unique book that should be required reading for every Richmonder, better yet, every American. --John V.

At university in Austin he became editor of the student magazine, <i>The Texas Ranger.</i> This was to prove Shelton&#x2019;s last &#x2018;real job&#x2019;. For in 1967, after contributing to various underground comix with his earliest character, Wonder Wart-Hog, and designing posters for rock concerts, Shelton created The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. In 1969 he and some friends from Texas moved to San Francisco to set up Rip Off Press from where Freak Brothers strips were soon syndicated, borrowed (or stolen!) by a host of American underground newspapers and magazines. The first collection was published in 1971 and has since been joined by thirteen further Freak Brothers adventures. Fat Freddy&#x2019;s Cat, the feline world&#x2019;s number one cat, started out as a footnote strip to the Freak Brothers but has led an independent &#x2013; and very successful &#x2013; life since 1975. In 1993 Shelton introduced new characters, Not Quite Dead, the world&#x2019;s least successful Rock Band who have since appeared in a series of comics of their own. Now 50 years later and unlike many cults from the sixties which have faded away, The Freak Brothers are still going from strength to strength. They are published in 15 languages and worldwide sales are now over 40 million copies plus millions of items of merchandise, T-shirts, postcards, badges, posters and more. Shelton currently lives in Paris, France with his wife and three cats."Gilbert Shelton is as near as comics have come to producing a natural comedic genius.

I like to tell stories about the things I&#x2019;ve seen as I&#x2019;ve traveled around the US, Canada and Europe, looking at hydronic radiant installations. I&#x2019;ve seen installers do things the right way and the wrong way, and I learned from them all. I dug into old books as well as the current literature to write this one, and I did my very best to boil down the engineering into understandable terms. This book contains 215 pages of practical, common sense information that you can use right away. I&#x2019;ve made lots of analogies to things you already know. Hydronic radiant heating doesn&#x2019;t have to be complicated or spooky. There are rules of thumb that work, and installers are using them with great success every day. There are simple ways to install and control these systems. I&#x2019;ll show you how. All in all, you&#x2019;re going to find straight answers to direct questions in this book.

Archaeological excavations reveal numerous local and family shrines where sacrifices and other rituals were carried out. Intrigued by this "folk religion" in all its variety and vitality, Dever writes about ordinary people in ancient Israel and their everyday religious lives.<br><br><i>Did God Have a Wife?</i>&nbsp;shines new light on the presence and influence of women's cults in early Israel and their implications for our understanding of Israel's official "Book religion." Dever pays particular attention to the goddess Asherah, reviled by the authors of the Hebrew Bible as a foreign deity but, in the view of many modern scholars, popularly envisioned in early Israel as the consort of biblical Yahweh. His work also gives new prominence to women as the custodians of Israel's folk religion.<br><br>The first book by an archaeologist on ancient Israelite religion, this fascinating study critically reviews virtually all of the archaeological literature of the past generation, while also bringing fresh evidence to the table. Though Dever digs deep into the past, his discussion is extensively illustrated, unencumbered by footnotes, and vivid with colorful insights. Meant for professional and general audiences alike,&nbsp;<i>Did God Have a Wife?</i>&nbsp;is sure to spur wide and passionate debate.</p><p><b>Susan Ackerman</b><br> "In&nbsp;<i>Did God Have a Wife?</i>&nbsp;Bill Dever presents a multidimensional portrait of ancient Israelite religion with his characteristic eloquence and panache. Most significantly, through his detailed examination of archaeological materials, Dever reveals crucial facets of what he calls 'folk religion,' or the religion of one of ancient Israel's most neglected communities, the everyday people."&nbsp;<b>Ronald Hendel</b><br> "Dever has done it again. The dean of biblical archaeology presents a wide-ranging and lively treatment of folk religion in ancient Israel, including the possibility of a prominent role for the goddess Asherah. Dever's synthesis of the archaeological evidence is masterful. This is a must-read for students of the Bible."&nbsp;<b>J. Edward Wright</b><br> "<i>Did God Have a Wife?</i>&nbsp;is the book that Bill Dever has been preparing to write for decades. In fact, he is probably the only person prepared and bold enough to attempt it. . . Dever finds that the only way to uncover the rich diversity of the religious impulse in ancient Israel is for archaeology to work in conversation with texts and iconography. . . Professionals will know much of the data but will nonetheless be impressed with Dever's synthesis of evidence from diverse sources. Lay readers will appreciate Dever's clear reconstruction and, at the same time, will be challenged by his conclusions. It is fitting that a book focusing on folk religion is written in a style that makes the information readily available to modern audiences."&nbsp;<b>Mark S. Smith</b><br> "A lucid treatment of a most provocative aspect of the Bible, namely, the question of a goddess in ancient Israel who might have been thought of as Yahweh's consort. Dever is one of the leading biblical archaeologists in the world, and he tackles one of the Bible's burning issues in this book. Fresh, clear, accessible, and recommended to anyone interested in the religion of ancient Israel."&nbsp;<b>Ziony Zevit</b><br> "Once again William Dever has written a page-turner for thoughtful individuals interested in the Bible. This time, however, he explores what most biblicists ignore &#x2014; the folk religion of ancient Israel, the religion as lived and practiced. . . Although written for the general public, this is one book that scholars cannot afford to miss. . . Writing in a personal style sprinkled with anecdotes, Dever has produced a rare work &#x2014; a book that may be read and appreciated by all who take the Bible, archaeology, and history seriously. Packed with information, crackling with brilliant observations."&nbsp;<b><i>Review of Biblical Literature</i></b><br> "I would like to recommend Dever's book to all ordinary people &#x2014; but especially to theologians &#x2014; who are interested in the &#x2018;real religion' of ancient Israel."&nbsp;<b><i>Catholic Biblical Quarterly</i></b><br> "Anything by the fiesty Dever is a must-read. He is state-of-the-art in the field of archaeology and religion, and he invariably enlightens and challenges."&nbsp;<b><i>Archiv Orent�ln�</i></b><br> "Highly persuasive in its portrayal, [<i>Did God Have a Wife?</i>] can become a welcome guide for all who are not afraid to adopt a somewhat alternate view of the ancient Israelite world."</p><h2>Style Guide (Economist Books)</h2><p><b>This expanded twelfth edition of the bestselling guide to style is based on <i>The Economist</i>'s own updated house style manual, and is an invaluable companion for everyone who wants to communicate with the clarity, style and precision for which <i>The Economist</i> is renowned.</b><br><br>As the introduction says, 'clarity of writing usually follows clarity of thought.'<br><br><i>The Economist </i>Style Guide gives general advice on writing, points out common errors and clich�s, offers guidance on consistent use of punctuation, abbreviations and capital letters and contains an exhaustive range of reference material--covering everything from accountancy ratios and stock market indices to laws of nature and science.<br><br>Some of the numerous useful rules and common mistakes pointed out in the guide include:<br><ul><li>Which informs, that defines.

Our destination was even darker. &#x201c;Women and children to the right. Men to the left,&#x201d; they shouted at us. Everything was taken from me, leaving only the smoke filled air, piercing screams, and soul-burning cries. I was slowly starved and weakened to the bone, but there was a man&#x2014;a Nazi&#x2014;who brought me extra food. He called himself a prisoner too, but he scared me, and I wondered if he was the enemy I should fear the most. &nbsp; Emma - Current Day: &nbsp; My grandmother hid her past in an old diary under her bed. The tattered, brown leather book sat there for years until she asked me to find it and read her unspoken words. Now, her stories and secrets are consuming every moment of my life. She&#x2019;s dying ... and asking for a man no one in our family has ever heard of. I never imagined a hand-written book could change my entire life, but it has. It opened my eyes to a new beginning, and I learned that love is not the unsaid word my grandmother has refused to speak. It&#x2019;s an action&#x2014;it&#x2019;s longevity, taboo and sometimes forbidden. Do we fight for what&#x2019;s wrong, or do we spend our lives searching for what&#x2019;s right? Last words were never spoken because love doesn&#x2019;t stop until a heart is no longer beating.</p><p>Shari J. Ryan is an International Bestselling Author of heartbreakers and mind-benders.

I felt every emotion the characters went through, one minute my heart caught in my throat, the next overwhelmed with the love these characters shared. I urge everyone to read this book. Allow the story to consume you as it consumed me, and remember the lesson that has sadly been forgotten lately... Love is stronger than hate." --USA Today Bestselling Author T.K. Leigh<br><br>"Reading Last Words was like another wake up call of how fortunate we are to be living in this world. Without all those people who fought for their rights to be Jews, I don't think any of us would exist. This book is everything. Maybe because I'm a Jew it had an extra influence on me. This is a story about surviving against all odds, loving against all odds, finding happiness in the middle of hell and maybe, just maybe a little bit of hope. ... The way it was written with the now and then's events made me sit on the edge of my seat waiting for what comes next.

Their influence can be seen permeating many of the modern Western Esoteric Traditions, which&nbsp;are the inheritors of the wisdom &amp; knowledge passed down through the ages. From Ancient Sumeria, to the Greeks, Romans, early Qabalists, Medieval &amp; Renaissance Grimoire Magickians through to the Victorian Occult Societies, the influence of the planets is clearly present in the symbolism of their ceremonies, practices &amp; beliefs.</p><p>In this practical sourcebook, the authors bring together old &amp; new techniques which they hope will inspire others to explore the multi-faceted world of planetary magick. There are simple planetary contemplations, hymns &amp; meditation journeys, ideal for the novice who wants to explore the symbolism of the planets &amp; in doing so learn to focus the different planetary energies.</p><p>Information is provided on the many spiritual beings associated with the planets - The Gods &amp; Goddesses who give their names to the planets, the Olympic Spirits, Archangels, Orders of Angels, Planetary Intelligences &amp; Planetary Spirits. Essential techniques for creating planetary sigils using the magick number squares, calculating planetary hours, making &amp; consecrating amulets &amp; talismans are given with practical examples.</p><p>Drawing from their experience &amp; knowledge gained working in a number of Western Esoteric Traditions, the authors also present original planetary techniques &amp; ceremonies,&nbsp;including the Ritual of the Heptagram, Planetary Pyramids, Planetary Magick Circles &amp; Angle Webs. The rich symbolism &amp; influence of the magick of the Wandering Stars underlies the spiritual &amp; magickal heritage of Western Esotericism. Through exploring &amp; working with the Deathless Powers, the reader can come to a greater understanding of the transformative powers they offer every true seeker of the Mysteries.</p></p><p><p>"This book is a little gem: why? There are snippets here and there in other books about Planetary Magick but you have to work out the rest of it yourself, as the infomrationis either too basic or incomplete. Now this book, ok, it may look a slim book, ut within its pages is everything you need, plus more, that you wanted to know about working with the Planets."

Well done!"<br> Angelica Lovkvist, Amazon Reviewer</p><p>"Well, for a star-gazing conjuring mortal immortal I personally found this book to be a jewel. Combining personal insight, scholarly references and practical applications this book will initiate the reader and practitioner regardless of how advanced they are, on a journey through the planetary realms flirting with ancient invocations, Hermetic Axioms, Renaissance Magia, the Grimoires, Archangels, Olympic Spirits, rites invoking the primordial epoches yet being applicable to the needs and preferences of contemporary Magoi, unbiased lists of correspondences, and 'hands on' meditations. Written in a very attractive and alluring fashion, I recommend this to all who seek to invoke the axiom of "I am a child of Earth and of Starry Heaven; But my race is of Heaven alone!""

This absorbing account of the essential elements of Eastern Orthodox thought deals with the Trinity, Christ, sin, humanity and creation as well as praying, icons, the sacraments and liturgy.</p><p><strong>Andrew Louth</strong> is professor emeritus of Patristic and Byzantine studies at Durham University, England. He is also a priest of the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Sourozh (Moscow Patriarchate), serving the parish in Durham. His recent publications include <em>Greek East and Latin West, AD 681-1071</em> (St Vladimir's Seminary Press), <em>Maximus the Confessor</em> (Routledge) and <em>The Origins of the Christian Mystical Tradition</em> (OUP)."Orthodox theology appears daunting at first glance, and with good reason, for terms and concepts differ from Western views in numerous and subtle ways. But in this volume Andrew Louth has opened a door into this faith that is both clear and accessible. Whether you've been Orthodox all your life, or have just begun to take an interest in Orthodoxy, this book will illumine your path." (Frederica Mathewes-Green, author of The Jesus Prayer, Facing East and The Illumined Heart)<br><br>"This personal presentation draws readers into a theology earthed in material reality and informed by liturgy which reflects the worship of heaven. Introductory and readable, it is illuminating for those already acquainted with the subject, and for non-Orthodox Christians it will facilitate an encounter with the depths of this 'other' tradition from which they will return with enriched understanding of their own." (Frances Young, OBE, FBA, emeritus professor of theology, University of Birmingham)<br><br>"This is a charming, readable and accessible book. Louth delivers with delightful clarity a genuine sense of how deep and rich are the traditional resources for thinking about aspects of Christian belief, and how the Eastern Orthodox tradition draws on the sacramental rites and regular prayer practices of generations of believers, and on the wealth of patristic philosophy." (Catherine Rowett, professor of philosophy, University of East Anglia)<br><br>"Andrew Louth brings a lifetime of superior patristic scholarship to this volume, but casts aside all the usual academic cares to offer us a direct, personal vision of Orthodoxy as he knows and loves it. Central to the endeavor is the crucible of prayer: this is the touchstone for everything he wants to commend in the tradition he has embraced as his own." (Sarah Coakley, Norris-Hulse Professor of Divinity, University of Cambridge)<br><br>"Andrew Louth has produced a humane, wise and very accessible introduction to the teaching and practice of Eastern Orthodoxy. He explains difficult doctrines in such a way that they make sense, and places a particular emphasis on prayer and worship. This is a truly excellent introduction, full of memorable passages and ideal for anyone who has wondered about Orthodoxy and wishes to have its main features explained." (Averil Cameron, DBE, FBA, professor of Late Antique and Byzantine history, University of Oxford)<br><br>"This is an exceptional introduction to Orthodoxy. Instead of presenting a summary of church history, teachings and practices, Andrew Louth grounds his account of the church and her theology in the encounter with God in liturgy and prayer, expounding historical controversies and theological themes as they arise out of that encounter. The result is both personal and profound, inviting readers to explore and experience for themselves the mystery of God in Christ."

Charles, Lord Sheridan, amateur sleuth for the British movers and shakers, discreetly probes a series of accidents and fatalities that have plagued the nascent efforts of Guglielmo Marconi to establish his wireless telegraph company. Sheridan is faced with a short deadline, as the Prince and Princess of Wales are due to attend a demonstration of Marconi's new technology. His wife, novelist and independent spirit Lady Kate Sheridan, takes an atypically subordinate role in identifying the culprit behind the industrial sabotage.

Letters, poems, captivity narratives, petitions, criminal autobiographies, economic treatises, travel accounts, and antislavery arguments were produced during a time of various and changing political and religious loyalties. Although the theme of liberation from physical or spiritual captivity runs throughout the collection, freedom also clearly led to hardship and disappointment for a number of these authors.<br><br>Briton Hammon, James Albert Ukawsaw Gronniosaw, John Marrant, Ignatius Sancho, Ottobah Cugoano, and Olaudah Equiano told their stories as Afro-Britons who recognized the sovereignty of George III; Johnson Green, Belinda, Benjamin Banneker, and Venture Smith spoke and wrote as African Americans n the United States; Phillis Wheatley, initially an Afro-British poet, later chose an African American identity; Francis Williams and George Liele wrote in Jamaica; David George and Boston King, having served with the British forces in the American Revolution and later lived in Canada, composed their narratives as British subjects in the newly established settlement in Sierra Leone, Africa.<br><br>In his introduction, Carretta reconstructs the historical and cultural context of the works, emphasizing the constraints of the eighteenth-century genres under which these authors wrote. The texts and annotations are based on extensive research in both published and manuscript holdings of archives in the United States and the United Kingdom. Appropriate for undergraduates as well as for scholars, <i>Unchained Voices</i> gives a clear sense of the major literary and cultural issues at the heart of African literature written in English.</p><p>Many of us know of the poet Phillis Wheatley, the first black woman to publish a book in the Americas, but many of her contemporaries in America and in England remain obscure. This anthology, compiled by Vincent Carretta, a professor of English at the University of Maryland, goes a long way toward rectifying that omission. Here, Carretta collects the work of nearly 20 black writers from the late 1700s. Some, like Ignatius Sancho, a black Londoner who corresponded with important figures of his day such as the author Laurence Sterne, and Olaudah Equiano, an early black abolitionist who created the slave narrative, are well known. Others, like the poet Francis Williams, or Johnson Green, who served in the Revolutionary Army, and whose confession before his execution in 1786 for burglary is included here, are less so. This is an important collection but, while Carretta provides an introduction and footnotes, one wishes he had provided brief biographies for each of the contributors.<b>Vincent Carretta</b>, professor of English at the University of Maryland, is the author of several books on eighteenth-century literature and, most recently, the editor of Olaudah Equiano's <i>The Interesting Narrative and Other Writings</i>.</p><h2>Separation of Church and State</h2><p><p>In a powerful challenge to conventional wisdom, Philip Hamburger argues that the separation of church and state has no historical foundation in the First Amendment. The detailed evidence assembled here shows that eighteenth-century Americans almost never invoked this principle. Although Thomas Jefferson and others retrospectively claimed that the First Amendment separated church and state, separation became part of American constitutional law only much later.</p><p>Hamburger shows that separation became a constitutional freedom largely through fear and prejudice. Jefferson supported separation out of hostility to the Federalist clergy of New England. Nativist Protestants (ranging from nineteenth-century Know Nothings to twentieth-century members of the K.K.K.) adopted the principle of separation to restrict the role of Catholics in public life. Gradually, these Protestants were joined by theologically liberal, anti-Christian secularists, who hoped that separation would limit Christianity and all other distinct religions. Eventually, a wide range of men and women called for separation. Almost all of these Americans feared ecclesiastical authority, particularly that of the Catholic Church, and, in response to their fears, they increasingly perceived religious liberty to require a separation of church from state. American religious liberty was thus redefined and even transformed. In the process, the First Amendment was often used as an instrument of intolerance and discrimination.</p></p><p>Philip Hamburger is Maurice and Hilda Friedman Professor of Law at Columbia Law School.&#x201c;Philip Hamburger has, simply, produced the best and most important book ever written on the subject of the separation of church and state in the United States. He has laid to rest the historical credentials of the Jeffersonian myth of the "wall of separation," and shown how the notion of separation gained wide acceptance in the nineteenth century primarily due to the pervasiveness of American anti-Catholicism. He has also destroyed the notion that separation is the only alternative to the union of church and state, and demonstrated that acceptance of separation has in fact undermined the vitality of our original anti-establishment notions of religious freedom. Hamburger underplays the current constitutional implications of his historical arguments, but it is clear that this book will have a profound impact on the current law and politics of church and state.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Stanley N.

Dreisbach, American University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Hamburger provides an alternate historical and political understanding concerning the development of the separation concept, relying on 17th-through 19th-century religious arguments and social patterns to challenge our accepted understanding of relationships between church and state...This clear historical analysis will be accessible to anyone interested in U.S. church-state relations and civil liberties. Highly recommended.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Steven Puro</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This volume presents the fascinating and complex history of interpretations of the First Amendment in the U.S. and argues that the amendment's antiestablishment clause did not mandate separation of church and state. Instead, Hamburger insists that separation, an idea that may mean far more than the absence of establishment, became a constitutional freedom over an extended period of time, largely through fear and prejudice...Recommended.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>S.

Strict separation was revived by anti-Catholics in the 19th century and picked up by the court in the 20th, a development for which Justice Hugo Black bore much responsibility. The modern era of judicial hostility to organized religion and its symbols in the public square is directly contrary to what the Framers meant when they prohibited the establishment of religion.

In <i>A Guided Tour Through the Museum of Communism</i>, she offers a eight-part exploration of Communism by way of an unusual cast of narrators, each from a different country, who reflect on the fall of Communism. Together they constitute an Orwellian send-up of absurdities during the final years of European Communism that showcase this author's tremendous talent.</p><p>Slavenka Drakulic was born in Croatia in 1949. The author of several works of nonfiction and novels, she has written for <b>The New York Times</b>, <b>The Nation</b>, <b>The New Republic</b>, and numerous publications around the world.Drakulic, Croatian journalist and author of Caf� Europa, presents a condensed and whimsical history of communism filtered through the perspective of animals who share little tales that largely focus on figures like Tito and Ceausescu. Along the way, Drakulic achieves a measured (if silly) survey of communism and its fall that is neither vitriolic nor nostalgic, nor wholly cynical or awed by Western capitalism. Running throughout is an awareness of how the past is eroding, with young people blissfully unaware of history. The animal narrators&#x2014;a mouse, a bear, a dog among them&#x2014;are generally charming, though the harshness of the book's subject and the quaintness of its methodology makes for odd pairings, with some of the attempted lightheartedness coming off as awkward or just plain botched (as with the pig who is supposedly writing an introduction to a cookbook but instead goes on a political screed). It's a strange project, partially successful, and likely to hold undeniable appeal to a limited audience. (Mar.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

She was no longer dazzled by the beauty of the two of them as she had been when she was small. Her father used to lift her high above his head and promise her that she was going to grow up to be as beautiful as her sister, Berengaria.<br>But he'd not told the truth. Not about that or, as it turned out, about a great many things. He'd not told the truth when he said they'd always have enough to eat and always have a warm, comfortable place to live. He'd not told the truth when he'd sworn that her mother would soon stop talking to her spirit people.<br>But most of all he'd lied about living forever.<br>Joby tossed her head of dark curls and looked up at her brother with stars in her eyes. Her hair had been shorn after she'd beaten some of the boys at sword play, and in retaliation, they had slathered her head with warm honey and pine pitch. Now her hair was growing back into glossy curls, and she found that she did indeed have one quite beautiful feature.<br>"The Maidenhall heiress," she repeated. "Oh, Jamie, just think of all that lovely money. Do you think she bathes in a gold tub? Does she wear emeralds to bed?"<br>"Nothing else is in her bed," Rhys, Jamie's man, said under his breath. "That father of hers keeps her as locked up as his gold."<br>Rhys gave a soft grunt as Thomas, Jamie's only other retainer, kicked him under the table.<br>Joby well knew the kick was to silence Rhys because they thought that at twelve years old she knew nothing about anything, and they wanted to keep it that way. Joby wasn't about to tell them what she knew or did not know, because in her opinion, there were already too many restrictions placed on her freedom. If any of the many adults in her life found out just exactly how much she did know, they'd start trying to find out where she had been to learn what she wasn't supposed to know.<br>Jamie's eyes were twinkling. "Perhaps not emeralds. But maybe she wears a silk nightgown."<br>"Silk," Joby said dreamily, her head propped on her hand. "Italian silk or French?"<br>At that everyone at the table laughed, and Joby knew she had an audience. She might not win attention for her looks, but she knew that she could make people laugh.<br>Maybe their branch of the Montgomery family couldn't afford jesters and other entertainers for dinner, or even much dinner for that matter, but Joby did what she could to enliven their otherwise dreary existence.<br>With one great leap she sprang to the top of the table, then bounded over it to the cold stone floor of the old castle.<br>With a bit of a frown, Jamie looked across the room at his mother, sitting so quietly, eating so little that no one could figure how she survived, but Joby's mannerless enthusiasm did not penetrate their mother's eternal dream world. She was vaguely looking in her youngest daughter's direction, but Jamie had no idea if she could see her or not. Or if she did, whether or not she remembered who she was. Their mother was as likely to call Joby Edward or Berengaria or, sometimes, Joby's real name of Margaret.<br>Jamie looked back at his young sister, as always dressed as a knight's page in tights and jerkin. For the thousandth time he told himself he had to force her to start dressing as a girl, but even as he thought it, he knew he hadn't the heart. Time enough for her to grow up and face the harshness of life. Let her be a child as long as possible.<br>"And how do you think she dresses each day?" Joby was saying as she stood before them. There were only five people at the table and a few servants -- all that were left to them -- beginning to straggle in from the kitchens, but Joby liked to imagine there were hundreds and she was on the stage before the queen.<br>Joby mimicked a woman awakening in the morning, stretching and yawning. "Bring me my gold chamber pot," she commanded imperiously and was rewarded with a laugh from her sister. If what she did made Berengaria laugh, then Jamie would allow her to continue.<br>Joby began making rather vulgar movements of a woman lifting her nightgown and settling herself onto a chamberpot. "Oh, my, but these emeralds do give me the most delicious pain," she said, wiggling about.<br>Jamie, who was whispering to Berengaria, raised one black eyebrow at Joby, letting her know she was not to go too far.<br>Joby straightened. "Here, bring me my dress. No! No! Not that one. Nor that one or that one or that one or that one. No, no, you fool. How many times have I told you that I have worn that gown before? I want <i>new</i> clothes. Always new clothes. What? This <i>is</i> a new gown? How do you expect the Maidenhall heiress to wear such as that? Why that silk is so thin it would...Why it would <i>bend</i> if I were to wear it."<br>At that Rhys began to laugh, and even Thomas, who rarely laughed, crooked one corner of his mouth up. They'd seen women at court who wore gowns so stiff they might as well have been carved of wood.<br>"Now," Joby said, standing back and looking at an imaginary gown, "this is more to my taste. Here, you men there, lift me into it."<br>At that even Thomas smiled broad enough to show his teeth, and a laugh escaped Jamie too.<br>Joby gave a great leap as though being lowered into the stiff dress, then waited while the hooks were latched.<br>"Now for my jewels." Joby pretended to be looking at several displays of jewels. "Yes, here are the emeralds and the rubies and diamonds, and here are pearls. Which shall I choose?" she asked as though in answer to a question. "Choose? How does one choose jewels? I shall, of course, wear them <i>all."</i><br>Spreading her legs apart as though bracing herself for a storm at sea, Joby extended her arms. "All right, men, put your hands behind my shoulders and brace me. Now, you there, put my jewels on me."<br>Everyone at the table was laughing as Joby extended first one foot, then the other, then an arm, then stretched her neck as though a hangman's rope had elongated it for her. Then, with her neck still stretched, she somehow managed to convey the impression to her audience that her head was now being weighed down with great, massive earrings. And when the jeweled headdress was placed on top of her head, she visually swayed under the weight.<br>By now everyone, servants, retainers, family, all except Joby's mother, were laughing helplessly.<br>"Release me now," Joby said to the imaginary men still bracing her shoulders. For a moment she swayed dangerously, about to go down, first one side, then the other, looking like a drunken sailor standing on the deck of a storm at sea. Just when she was about to go down, she righted herself and finally, at last, with great dignity, held herself erect.<br>With difficulty, the audience quieted and awaited what came next.<br>"Now," Joby said with gravity, "I shall see this man who is to escort me, the richest woman in all of England, across the country. I will see if he is worthy of taking me to the man my father has contracted for me to marry. But wait, tell me of him."<br>Everyone at the table was sneaking looks at Jamie as he ducked his head shyly, holding Berengaria's hand close to his heart. He'd only been home for a fewdays, and he found he could not bear to allow any of his family out of his sight or touch.<br>"James Montgomery," Joby said. "Ah yes, I have heard of that family. A bit of money there, but not much. But then no one has riches to compare to me, do they? What?! Speak up! I cannot hear you. Yes, yes, that is better. I know in my heart how rich I am, but I am still a woman and I like to hear it said aloud."<br>For a moment she was lost in thought as she admired her left arm. "Now, what was I speaking of? Oh yes. This man who has the privilege, the honor, of escorting me. He is a Montgomery. What is it you say? He is of the <i>poor</i> branch of the Montgomerys?"<br>Joby's pixie face with its sharp nose wrinkled in puzzlement. "Poor? I do not believe I know this word. Please explain it to me."<br>When the laughter had quieted again, she continued. "Ah, I see. People who have only a hundred silk dresses and only small jewels. What? No jewels? No silk? What's that? You say this man lives in a house with only part of a roof and sometimes no meat on the table?"<br>At this Jamie frowned, knowing that this was why he'd agreed to take on the degrading employment of escorting some spoiled heiress across England to join her almost-as-rich fianc�. But even so, he did not like to hear it said aloud.<br>Joby ignored her brother's frown. "If he has nothing to eat, he must be rather...small," she said in wonder, making Jamie laugh and forget his very real problems. Small he was not.<br>"Shall I carry him about in a box?" Joby asked, holding up her hands, not forgetting to act as though her arms were weighed down with hundreds of jewels.<br>She kept her fingers spread wide because her imaginary rings were so large they wouldn't allow her to close her fingers. "A jeweled box, of course," she said. "Ah yes, perhaps this is good. I see a way to carry more jewels. What! Is this box not made yet? You are dismissed! And you! And -- Oh, I see, he is not small. He does not eat, but he is not small. I do not understand. But perhaps you had better send him in and let me see this...this...What was that word again? Ah, yes, poor. Let me see this moor, er, ah, poor person."<br>At this Joby did a pantomime of the Maidenhall heiress standing utterly still, weighed down with all her many hundreds of jewels, and awaiting the arrival of James Montgomery.<br>Out of the side of her mouth, Joby made a creaking noise as of rusty door hinges trying to open. "I have it on authority," she said as an aside to her audience, "that gold hinges creak abominably. That's why we refuse to have them here."<br>In the next moment Joby's face changed to astonishment: her mouth dropped open, her eyes widened, then she threw her arm across her eyes as though to keep a bright light from blinding her. "You are too beautiful," she said in a loud stage whisper.<br>At that, Jamie's face turned red, and his two men, who were sick of seeing women make fools of themselves over the extraordinary beauty of Jamie, fell about themselves laughing.<br>"No jewel in the world," Joby shouted above the loud laughter of the men, "could compare with your beauty. Oh, I must have you. Must, must, must have you. Here!" she said and began pantomiming the removal of all her jewels, sliding them off her arms, her neck, her ears; running her hands along her head to remove great handfuls of them; tossing each precious piece at him.<br>"You must marry me," Joby cried. "I cannot live without you. You are what I have been looking for all my life. Next to you, emeralds are dark; they do not twinkle as brightly as your eyes. Pearls have no luster next to your skin. Diamonds cannot -- "<br>She broke off because Jamie grabbed the worn cushion from under him and threw it at her, hitting her squarely on her flat chest.<br>Catching it, she clasped it tightly. "This is from my most beautiful beloved. He...Oh, heavens, but he <i>sat</i> on it. That most tender part of him has touched it. Would that my eyes and lips could share what this lowly cushion has -- "<br>This time she stopped because Jamie had bounded over the table and clasped his hand over her mouth. She nipped his little finger with her sharp teeth, and taken in surprise, he released his grip on her.<br>"His arms about me," she said loudly. "I shall die from the pleasure of it."<br>"You shall die if you do not shut up," Jamie said. "Where have you learned such things as you have said? No, do not tell me. But if you have no care for my own delicate sensibilities, think how you shock your dear sister."<br>Joby peeped around the great bulk of her brother to see her sister's lovely face flushed with merriment. It suited her and her sister to pretend that Berengaria was as innocent and as angelic as she looked. The truth was that Joby was completely honest with her sister, often keeping her up half the night with tales of her latest escapade.<br>"Go!" Jamie commanded, motioning his arm to include everyone in the room. "Your ridicule of me is at an end. Tell me, little sister, what did you do for entertainment when I was not here to make merry of?"<br>Never at a loss for words, Joby said, "It was a solemn household. With only Father and Edward -- She broke off, the back of her hand going to her mouth.<br>For a moment there was silence in the worn, old hall as everyone seemed to have forgotten that just two days ago they had attended a double funeral. Technically, the household was in mourning, deep mourning, for the loss of the father and the eldest son of this branch of the Montgomery family. But the son, Edward, had never shared in the simple joys of family life, and their father had been absent, barricaded in his room at the top of the tower. It was difficult to weep for people who you rarely saw or, in Edward's case, did not miss.<br>"Yes," Jamie said calmly. "I think it is time we remembered what we are about." With his back rigid, he walked around the table to escort Berengaria from the room.<br>It was only minutes later that he was alone with his sister.<br>"Why did someone not tell me?" Jamie asked, standing before the tiny, crumbling window in Berengaria's room. Reaching out his hand, he broke a piece of stone away. Water damage. Years ago, while he'd been away, the lead gutters had been sold off the old stone keep, so the water seeped into the stone.<br>Turning, he looked at his sister as she sat serenely on her cushioned chair, a chair more suited for a peasant's hut than what had once been the keep of a proud and glorious estate. "Why did no one tell me?" he asked again.<br>Berengaria opened her mouth to give the explanation she'd planned to give, but instead, she told the truth. "Pride. That great Montgomery curse of pride." She hesitated, then smiled. "That pride that is now making your stomach churn and bringing out the sweat on your brow. Tell me, are you toying with the dagger Father gave you?"<br>For a moment Jamie didn't know what she was talking about but then realized that he was indeed holding the beautiful golden-handled dagger his father had given him long ago. The jewels in the hilt had been replaced with glass years ago, but if the dagger were held just so in the sunlight, one could see the gold that still coated the steel handle.<br>He gave a laugh. "I had forgotten how well you know me." With one easy movement, he sat on a cushion at her feet and leaned his head against her knee, closing his eyes in pleasure as she stroked his hair.<br>"I never saw any woman who could compare with you in beauty," he said softly.<br>"Is that not a vain thing for you to say as we are twins?"<br>He kissed her hand. "I am old and ugly and scarred, whereas you are untouched by time."<br>"Untouched is true," she said, trying to make a joke about her virginity.<br>But Jamie did not smile. Instead, he put his hand up before her face.<br>"It is no use," she said, smiling sweetly, catching his hand. "I cannot see lighted twigs before my face. There is no sight for me, and no man wants a blind wife. For all the use I am to the world, it would have been better had I died at birth."<br>The violence with which Jamie arose startled her. "Oh, Jamie, I am sorry. I did not mean -- It was thoughtless of me. Please, come sit down again. Let me touch you. Please."<br>He sat down again, but his heart was pounding. Pounding with guilt. He and his sister were twins, but Jamie had been quite a bit bigger than his sister and so had taken hours to be born. When Berengaria was finally allowed out, the umbilical cord was found to be wrapped around her neck, and it was soon discovered that she ...</p><h2>Trusting Jesus</h2><p>Book by Holland, Jeffrey R.</p><p></p><h2>Before She Was Found: A Novel</h2><p><strong>A gripping thriller about three young girlfriends, a dark obsession and a chilling crime that shakes up a quiet Iowa town, from the </strong><strong><em>New York Times</em></strong><strong> bestselling author of </strong><strong><em>The Weight of Silence</em></strong><strong>.</strong><br><br>For twelve-year-old Cora Landry and her friends Violet and Jordyn, it was supposed to be an ordinary sleepover&#x2014;movies and Ouija and talking about boys.

Oh, it pulls and whines and shines in a cheap and guttering imitation of what it should do, but there is no edge to it. This moon has no wind in it to sail carnivores across the happy night sky and into slash&#x2013;and&#x2013;slice ecstasy. Instead this moon flickers shyly through a squeaky&#x2013;clean window, onto a woman who perches all cheerful and perky on the edge of the couch and talks about flowers, canapes, and Paris.<br><br>Paris?<br><br>Yes, with moon&#x2013;faced seriousness, Paris is what she is talking about in that far&#x2013;spreading syrupy tone. She is talking about Paris. Again.<br><br>So what kind of moon can this possibly be, with its near&#x2013;breathless smile and smirking lace around the edges? It batters feebly at the window, but it can&#x2019;t quite get in past all the sickly&#x2013;sweet warbling. And what kind of Dark Avenger could simply sit across the room, as poor Dazed Dexter does now, pretending to listen while mooning blearily on his chair?<br><br>Why, this moon must be a honeymoon&#x2014;unfurling its marital banner across the living&#x2013;room night, signaling for all to rally round, sound the charge, once more into the church, dear friends&#x2014;because Dexter of the Deadly Dimples is getting married. Hitched to the wagon of bliss pulled by the lovely Rita, who has turned out to have a lifelong passion to see Paris.<br><br>Married, honeymoon in Paris...Do these words really belong in the same sentence as any reference at all to our Phantom Flenser?<br><br>Can we really see a suddenly sober and simpering slasher at the altar of an actual church, in Fred Astaire tie and tails, slipping the ring onto a white&#x2013;wrapped finger while the congregation sniffles and beams? And then Demon Dexter in madras shorts, gawking at the Eiffel Tower and snarfing cafe au lait at the Arc de Triomphe? Holding hands and trundling giddily along the Seine, staring vacantly at every gaudy trinket in the Louvre?<br><br>Of course, I suppose I could make a pilgrimage to the Rue Morgue, a sacred site for serial slashers.<br><br>But let us be just a tiny bit serious for a moment: Dexter in Paris? For starters, are Americans still allowed to go to France? And for finishers, Dexter in Paris? On a <i>honeymoon</i>? How can someone of Dexter&#x2019;s midnight persuasions possibly consider anything so ordinary? How can someone who considers sex as interesting as deficit accounting enter into marriage? In short, how by all that is unholy, dark, and deadly can Dexter really mean to do this?<br><br>All wonderful questions, and very reasonable. And in truth, somewhat difficult to answer, even to myself. But here I am, enduring the Chinese water torture of Rita&#x2019;s expectations and wondering how Dexter can possibly go through with this.<br><br>Well then. Dexter can go through with this because he must, in part to maintain and even upgrade his necessary disguise, which prevents the world at large from seeing him for what he is, which is at best not something one would really like to have sitting across the table when the lights go out&#x2014;especially if there is silverware present. And quite naturally, it takes a great deal of careful work to make sure it is not generally known that Dexter is driven by his Dark Passenger, a whispery&#x2013;silk voice in the shaded backseat that from time to time climbs into the front seat to take the wheel and drive us to the Theme Park of the Unthinkable. It would never do to have the sheep see that Dexter is the wolf among them.<br><br>And so work we do, the Passenger and I, work very hard at our disguise. For the past several years we have had Dating Dexter, designed to present a cheerful and above all normal face to the world. This charming production featured Rita as the Girlfriend, and it was in many ways an ideal arrangement, since she was as uninterested in sex as I am, and yet wanted the companionship of an Understanding Gentleman. And Dexter really does understand. Not humans, romance, love, and all that gabble. No. What Dexter understands is the lethally grinning bottom line, how to find the utterly deserving among Miami&#x2019;s oh&#x2013;so&#x2013;many candidates for that final dark election to Dexter&#x2019;s modest Hall of Fame.<br><br>This does not absolutely guarantee that Dexter is a charming companion; the charm took years of practice, and it is the pure artificial product of great laboratory skill. But alas for poor Rita&#x2014;battered by a terribly unfortunate and violent first marriage&#x2014;she can&#x2019;t seem to tell the margarine from the butter.<br><br>All well and good. For two years Dexter and Rita cut a brilliant swathe across the Miami social scene, noticed and admired everywhere. But then, through a series of events that might well leave an enlightened observer somewhat skeptical, Dexter and Rita had become accidentally engaged. And the more I pondered on how to extricate myself from this ridiculous fate, the more I realized that it was a logical next step in the evolution of my disguise. A married Dexter&#x2014;a Dexter with two ready&#x2013;made children!&#x2014;is surely a great deal further from seeming to be anything at all like what he really is. A quantum leap forward, onto a new level of human camouflage.<br><br>And then there are the two children.<br><br>It may seem strange that someone whose only passion is for human vivisection should actually enjoy Rita&#x2019;s children, but he does. I do. Mind you, I don&#x2019;t get all weepy&#x2013;eyed at the thought of a lost tooth, since that would require the ability to feel emotion, and I am quite happily without any such mutation. But on the whole, I find children a great deal more interesting than their elders, and I get particularly irritable with those who cause them harm. In fact, I occasionally search them out. And when I track these predators down, and when I am very sure that they have actually done what they have been doing, I make sure they are quite unable to do it ever again&#x2014;and with a very happy hand, unspoiled by conscience.<br><br>So the fact that Rita had two children from her disastrous first marriage was far from repellent, particularly when it became apparent that they needed Dexter&#x2019;s special parenting touch to keep their own fledgling Dark Passengers strapped into a safe, snug Dark Car Seat until they could learn how to drive for themselves. For presumably as a result of the emotional and even physical damage inflicted on Cody and Astor by their drug&#x2013;addled biological father, they too had turned to the Dark Side, just like me. And now they were to be my children, legally as well as spiritually. It was almost enough to make me feel that there was some guiding purpose to life after all.<br><br>And so there were several very good reasons for Dexter to go through with this&#x2014;but Paris? I don&#x2019;t know where it came from, this idea that Paris is romantic. Aside from the French, has anyone but Lawrence Welk ever thought an accordion was sexy? And wasn&#x2019;t it by now clear that they don&#x2019;t like us there? And they insist on speaking French, of all things?<br><br>Perhaps Rita had been brainwashed by an old movie, something with a perky&#x2013;plucky blonde and a romantic dark-haired man, modernist music playing as they pursue each other around the Eiffel Tower and laugh at the quaint hostility of the dirty, Gauloise&#x2013;smoking man in the beret. Or maybe she had heard a Jacques Brel record once and decided it spoke to her soul. Who can say? But somehow Rita had the notion firmly welded into her steel&#x2013;trap brain that Paris was the capital of sophisticated romance, and the idea would not come out without major surgery.<br><br>So on top of the endless debates about chicken versus fish and wine versus cash bar, a series of monomaniacal rambling monologues about Paris began to emerge. Surely we could afford a whole week, that would give us time to see the Jardin des Tuileries and the Louvre&#x2014;and maybe something by Moliere at the Comedie&#x2013;Francaise. I had to applaud the depth of her research. For my part, my interest in Paris had faded away completely long ago when I learned that it was in France.<br><br>Luckily for us, I was saved from the necessity of finding a politic way of telling her all this when Cody and Astor made their subtle entrance. They don&#x2019;t barrel into a room with guns blazing as most children of seven and ten do. As I have said, they were somewhat damaged by their dear old biological dad, and one consequence is that you never see them come and go: they enter the room by osmosis. One moment they are nowhere to be seen and the next they are standing quietly beside you, waiting to be noticed.<br><br>&#x201c;We want to play kick the can,&#x201d; Astor said. She was the spokesperson for the pair; Cody never put more than four words together in a single day. He was not stupid, very far from it. He simply preferred not to speak most of the time. Now he just looked at me and nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; said Rita, pausing in her reflections on the land of Rousseau, Candide, and Jerry Lewis, &#x201c;well then, why don&#x2019;t you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We want to play kick the can with Dexter,&#x201d; Astor added, and Cody nodded very loudly.<br><br>Rita frowned. &#x201c;I guess we should have talked about this before, but don&#x2019;t you think Cody and Astor&#x2014;I mean, shouldn&#x2019;t they start to call you something more, I don&#x2019;t know&#x2014;but just Dexter? It seems kind of&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How about<i> mon papere</i>?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Or <i>Monsieur le Comte</i>?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How about, I don&#x2019;t think so?&#x201d; muttered Astor.<br><br>&#x201c;I just think&#x2014;&#x201d; said Rita.<br><br>&#x201c;Dexter is fine,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re used to it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t seem respectful,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>I looked down at Astor. &#x201c;Show your mother you can say &#x2018;Dexter&#x2019; respectfully,&#x201d; I told her.<br><br>She rolled her eyes. &#x201c;Puh-<i>leeeeeze</i>,&#x336;...</p><h2>Civil War Volume III (History of England)</h2><p>In Civil War, Peter Ackroyd continues his dazzling account of England&#39;s history, beginning with the progress south of the Scottish king, James VI, who on the death of Elizabeth I became the first Stuart king of England, and ends with the deposition and flight into exile of his grandson, James II. The Stuart dynasty brought together the two nations of England and Scotland into one realm, albeit a realm still marked by political divisions that echo to this day. More importantly, perhaps, the Stuart era was marked by the cruel depredations of civil war, and the killing of a king. Ackroyd paints a vivid portrait of James I and his heirs. Shrewd and opinionated, the new King was eloquent on matters as diverse as theology, witchcraft and the abuses of tobacco, but his attitude to the English parliament sowed the seeds of the division that would split the country in the reign of his hapless heir, Charles I. Ackroyd offers a brilliant - warts and all - portrayal of Charles&#39;s nemesis Oliver Cromwell, Parliament&#39;s great military leader and England&#39;s only dictator, who began his career as a political liberator but ended it as much of a despot as &#39;that man of blood&#39;, the king he executed. England&#39;s turbulent seventeenth century is vividly laid out before us, but so too is the cultural and social life of the period, notable for its extraordinarily rich literature, including Shakespeare&#39;s late masterpieces, Jacobean tragedy, the poetry of John Donne and Milton and Thomas Hobbes&#39; great philosophical treatise, Leviathan. Civil War also gives us a very real sense of the lives of ordinary English men and women, lived out against a backdrop of constant disruption and uncertainty.</p><p>Peter Ackroyd is an award-winning novelist, as well as a broadcaster, biographer, poet and historian. He is the author of the acclaimed non-fiction bestsellers, Thames: Sacred River and London: The Biography. He holds a CBE for services to literature and lives in London.</p><h2>Still Philadelphia: A Photographic History, 1890-1940</h2><p><p>This is a book about Philadelphia and about photography, but it is not the usual book about either. On one level, this is the pictorial story of a great industrial metropolis in transition. It is the story of a railroad city, a city of trolleys and subways and horse-drawn vehicles, as it gradually succumbed to the automobile. It is the story of a city filled with neighborhood industry giving way to suburbs, to commuter travel, and to a change in the very nature of work. It is the story of a city spreading out, expanding and doubling in population in fifty years. It is the story of urban exuberance and vitality where ethnic groups mixed and mingled, but it is also the story of slums and poverty, crime and conflict.

With black humor sprinkled throughout, the book, a profound look at psychic loss and puzzlement by a writer at the height of his powers, illustrates � Cadhain&#x2019;s conviction that tragedy and comedy are inextricably connected.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bringing this work to an English-speaking audience for the first time, this volume includes an illuminating introduction by Alan Titley, whose skillful translation captures the spirit and tone of the original.</p><p><b>M�irt�n � Cadhain </b>(1906&#x2013;1970) is considered one of the most significant writers in the Irish language. <b>Alan Titley</b> is a novelist, playwright, and scholar.

Using the voices of the dead, it dramatises the battle between life and death, time and infinity, the individual and the community. It is filled with gossip and banter, all the more lively because the voices live underground.

It has a composer&#x2019;s grasp of tempo and of thematic signature. It is finally through it that we begin to see the nature of O Cadh�in&#x2019;s achievement.

Starting with the story of how he once forgot the name of an Italian painter&#x2014;and how a young acquaintance mangled a quotation from Virgil through fears that his girlfriend might be pregnant&#x2014;it brings together a treasure trove of muddled memories, inadvertent actions, and verbal tangles. Amusing, moving, and deeply revealing of the repressed, hypocritical Viennese society of his day, Freud's dazzling interpretations provide the perfect introduction to psychoanalytic thinking in action.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

It is filled with anecdotes, many of them quite amusing, and virtually bereft of difficult technical terminology. And Freud put himself on the line: numerous acts of willful forgetting or &#39;inexplicable&#39; mistakes are recounted from his personal experience. None of such actions can be called truly accidental, or uncaused: that is the real lesson of the Psychopathology.<b>Sigmund Freud</b>&nbsp;(1856-1939) was born in Moravia and lived in Vienna between the ages of four and eighty-two. In 1938 Hitler's invasion of Austria forced him to seek asylum in London, where he died the following year.&nbsp;Freud's career began with several years of brilliant work on the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system. He was almost thirty when, after a period of study under Charcot in Paris, his interests first turned to psychology, and another ten years of clinical work in Vienna (at first in collaboration with Breuer, an older colleague) saw the birth of his creation: psychoanalysis. This began simply as a method of treating neurotic patients by investigating their minds, but it quickly grew into an accumulation of knowledge about the workings of the mind in general, whether sick or healthy. Freud was thus able to demonstrate the normal development of the sexual instinct in childhood and, largely on the basis of an examination of dreams, arrived at his fundamental discovery of the unconscious forces that influence our everyday thoughts and actions. Freud's life was uneventful, but his ideas have shaped not only many specialist disciplines, but the whole intellectual climate of the last half-century.<br><br><b>Anthea Bell</b> translated E. T. A.

Fast food often gets a bad rap, but the truth is Americans still harbor a (sometimes secret) love for it. In <em>Drive-Thru Dreams</em>, Adam Chandler introduces us to the entrepreneurs, drop-outs, and dreamers who built empires out of nothing, and mentored others to follow in their footsteps. We meet the people who work in fast food restaurants and those who gather around their Formica tables&#x2014; these are places where all share a common experience, rich or poor, young or old. Fast food has changed over the decades, including the re-branding of such establishments as quick-serve restaurants. Chandler looks at the evolution of the industry&#x2019;s business models and menu items, from healthier options embraced (or shunned) by consumers to what you&#x2019;ll find at franchises around the globe. <em>Drive-Thru Dreams</em> is a fascinating and incredibly fun read that will change the way you think about this most American of industries. ---<em>Seira Wilson, Amazon Book Review</em>ADAM CHANDLER is a writer based in Brooklyn.

As his narration unfolds, we are given an intimate picture of the loves and infidelities, the scandals, the youthful ardor and regrets of age that tie Silvio to the long-guarded secrets of the past.</p><p>Amazon Best of the Month, October 2007: As the Nazis advanced on France, celebrated writer Ir�ne N�mirovsky composed two final masterworks: <i>Suite Fran�aise</i> and <i>Fire in the Blood</i>. The first, smuggled out in a suitcase by her escaping daughters when N�mirovsky was taken to her death at Auschwitz in 1942, surfaced more than 60 years later and restored her bestselling status. The other, two pages of which slipped out in that same suitcase, was thought lost--until biographers discovered the rest of the manuscript in papers given to N�mirovsky's editor for safekeeping. A worthy companion to <i>Suite Fran�aise</i>, it follows three interwoven stories across two decades, when the hot-blooded affairs of youth threaten the cool calm of middle age. Once it has all unraveled, the last line lodges in your heart like a sliver.

There is breathless storytelling and ponderous cataloguing; there is fervent religious devotion and playful teasing. The poems translated here are meant to provide a sense of some of this range and diversity; in doing so they also offer significant portions of three of the important manuscripts of Old English poetry&#x2015;the Vercelli Book, the Junius Manuscript, and the Exeter Book. </p></p><p><p> Contributing Editor &amp; Translator <strong>R.M.

Liuzza&#x2019;s anthology of highly accurate, scholarly, poetic translations captures the full expressive range of the oldest poetry in English: the mournful note of elegy, the profound beat of wisdom poetry, the ardent music of faith, and the high songs of heroic fame.&#x201d; &#x2015; Andrew Scheil, University of Minnesota </p> <p> &#x201c;The translations are beautiful&#x2015;those of the elegies quite stunningly so. ...

What is this Truth that we must know? What is the freedom that it gives? These are some of the questions answered by Joel Goldsmith in Spiritual Power of Truth. <br><br>The fact that Truth is true is of no avail to us, Goldsmith tells us. That is why you ve got to know the Truth. You have to know it consciously and you have to know it constantly. The responsibility is upon your shoulders. He explains, The teachings of the world have not gone beyond seeking Truth through the mind, through books, and through teachings, and until you realize that you never are going to find the Truth in this way, you have not even begun your spiritual journey. The Truth, this secret behind the universe, it is not to be known with the mind or through the mind. <br><br>How, then, are we to know the Truth? Goldsmith makes it clear that knowing the truth does not mean intellectually understanding statements of truth or repeatedly affirming them. Rather, knowing the truth is a deep realization in consciousness that comes through meditation and living the spiritual principles. Only when we have that realization can we experience the spiritual power of Truth. At the core of this realization, he explains, is always the truth that I and the Father are one. <br><br>In Spiritual Power of Truth, Goldsmith guides the reader through the terrain of spiritual wisdom on the subject of Truth, including the relationship of Truth and spiritual healing; the meaning of spiritual power and how it has been misinterpreted; the meaning of illusion; and how our knowing the truth can benefit others. Throughout the book, Goldsmith anchors his teaching in the spiritual truths that constitute the message of the Infinite Way: the nature of God, man, prayer, and error. Finally, ever determined that students will not simply take his word as truth but make it their own, he reminds the reader: There is no way on earth that you are ever going to know that you have learned a lesson of Truth unless you demonstrate it, you prove it to be so.</p><p>JOEL S. GOLDSMITH (1892-1964), a monumental teacher of practical mysticism, devoted most of his life to the discovery and teaching of spiritual principles which he founded and called The Infinite Way. After the publication of his seminal book, The Infinite Way, in 1947, Joel traveled throughout the world as a teacher and a healer. Although Goldsmith&#39;s message was neither organized nor advertised, students of The Infinite Way increased in numbers. Today, a worldwide student body exists which continues to practice and preserve his work. More than thirty books have been compiled from his tape-recorded lectures and classwork including &#34;The InfiniteWay,&#34; &#34;Practicing the Presence&#34; and &#34;The Art of Meditation.&#34;</p><h2>The PEACE Process: Attract a Steady Stream of Clients and Create a Thriving Holistic Practice</h2><p><i>Build A Thriving Holistic Practice Without Losing Your Shirt, Your Sanity, or Your Soul</i> <br><br> Imagine waking up each day feeling as confident in your ability to promote your practice as you do about your ability to heal your clients.

They put government to work to ensure a thriving middle class. When the middle class took a hit, beginning in the post-Civil War Gilded Age and culminating in the Great Depression, democracy-loving leaders like Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and Dwight Eisenhower revitalized it through initiatives like antitrust regulations, fair labor laws, the minimum wage, Social Security, and Medicare. <br><br> So what happened? Air America Radio host Thom Hartmann shows that over the last twenty-five years, we&#x2019;ve witnessed an undeclared war against the middle class. The so-called conservatives waging this war are only interested in conserving&#x2014;and steadily increasing&#x2014;their own wealth and power. Hartmann shows how, under the guise of &#x201c;freeing&#x201d; the market, they&#x2019;ve systematically dismantled the programs set up by both Republicans and Democrats to protect the middle class and have replaced them with policies that favor the only the privileged few.<br><br> But the middle class is the very thing that makes America great. Thomas Jefferson himself believed that our very democracy depends upon our ability to play referee to the game of business, protecting labor and the public good. It is both our right and our responsibility, Jefferson wrote, to control &#x201c;overgrown wealth&#x201d; from becoming &#x201c;dangerous to the state.&#x201d; <br><br> We must not stand by while our democracy becomes a corporatocracy, serving an elite group of billionaire CEOs. There is another way. Thomas Jefferson knew how to build a middle class. Franklin Roosevelt knew how. We&#x2019;ve done it before and we can do it, again. Following Hartmann&#x2019;s commonsense proposals, we can recreate a prospering middle class that will ensure that our public institutions are not turned into private fiefdoms, meet people&#x2019;s basic needs&#x2014;for education, health care, a living wage&#x2014;and keep America strong,</p><p>Thom Hartmann is the host of a nationally syndicated Air America Radio program and is the author of eighteen books, including The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight: The Fate of the World and What We Can Do Before It&#x2019;s Too Late; We the People: A Call to Take Back America; What Would Jefferson Do?, and Unequal Protection: The Rise of Corporate Dominance and the Theft of Human Rights.Profits before People<br><br> THE STORY OF CARL<br><br> Carl loved books and he loved history. After spending two years in the army as part of the American occupation forces in Japan immediately after World War II, Carl was hoping to graduate from college and teach history&#x2014;perhaps even at the university level&#x2014;if he could hang on to the GI Bill and his day job long enough to get his PhD. But in 1950, when he&#x2019;d been married just a few months, the surprise came that forced him to drop out of college: his wife was pregnant with their first child.<br><br> This was an era when husbands worked, wives tended the home, and being a good father and provider was one of the highest callings to which a man could aspire. Carl dropped out of school, kept his 9-to-5 job at a camera shop, and got a second job at a metal fabricating plant, working with molten metal from 7:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. For much of his wife&#x2019;s pregnancy and his newborn son&#x2019;s first year, he slept three hours a night and caught up on the weekends, but in the process he earned enough to get them an apartment and prepare for the costs of raising a family. Over the next forty-five years, he continued to work in the steel and machine industry, in the later years as a bookkeeper/manager for a Michigan tool-and-die company as three more sons were born.<br><br> Carl knew he was doing the right thing when he took that job in the factory, and he did it enthusiastically. Because the auto industry was unionized, he found he was able to support his entire family&#x2014;all four sons&#x2014;on one paycheck. He had fully funded health insurance, an annual vacation, and a good pension waiting for him when he retired. Carl had become a member of the middle class. He may not have achieved his personal dream of teaching history, but he had achieved the American dream. He was self-sufficient and free.<br><br> Working with molten metal could be dangerous, but the dangers were apparent, and Carl took every precaution to protect himself so that he could return home safe to his family. What he didn&#x2019;t realize, however, was that the asbestos used at the casting operation was an insidious poison. He didn&#x2019;t realize that the asbestos industry had known for decades that the stuff could kill but would continue to profitably market it for another twenty years while actively using its financial muscle to keep the general public in the dark and prevent the government from interfering.<br><br> A couple of years ago, Carl tripped on the stairs and ended up in the hospital with a compression fracture of his spine. He figured that fall also caused the terrible pain he&#x2019;d been experiencing in his abdomen. The doctors, however, discovered that his lungs were filled with mesothelioma, a rare form of lung cancer that is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos. Mesothelioma is terminal, and its victims die by slow and painful suffocation.<br><br> Just because some corporation put profit before people, Carl got screwed.<br><br> I was Carl&#x2019;s first child.<br><br> AN UNDECLARED WAR<br><br> My dad faced a painful death, but at least his job in a union shop left him with health care after retirement. Most Americans don&#x2019;t even have that reassurance anymore. More than 45 million Americans don&#x2019;t have health insurance to cover expenses for a serious illness; 5 million have lost their health insurance in the past four years alone. And it&#x2019;s not just illness that worries most Americans today. Americans are working more and making less. It&#x2019;s getting harder and harder to just get by.<br><br> There&#x2019;s a reason for the pain Americans are suffering.<br><br> The America my dad grew up in put people before profits. The America he lives in now puts profits before people.<br><br> In my dad&#x2019;s America, 35 percent of working people were union members who got a living wage, health insurance, and defined-benefits pensions. These union benefits lifted all boats because they set the floor for employment; for every union job, there was typically a nonunion job with similar pay and benefits (meaning roughly 70 percent of the American workforce back then could raise a family on a single paycheck). People who were disabled and couldn&#x2019;t work could live on Social Security payments, and the elderly knew they would have a safe retirement, paid for by pensions, Social Security, and Medicare. The gap between the richest and the poorest shrunk rather than widened.<br><br> That America is disappearing fast. The minimum wage&#x2014;just $5.15 per hour&#x2014;is not a living wage. Workers are now expected to pay for their own health insurance and their own retirement. Pension plans are disappearing&#x2014;30,000 General Motors employees lost theirs in 2005&#x2014;and there&#x2019;s continued talk of privatizing Social Security. The safety net is ripping apart, and the results are that the middle class is shrinking. The rich are once again getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer:<br><br> Image The inflation-adjusted average annual pay of a CEO went up from $7,773,000 to $9,600,000 from 2002 to 2004. Meanwhile, from 2000 to 2004, the inflation-adjusted median annual household income went down from $46,058 to $44,389. In other words, ordinary people&#x2019;s income went down by $1,669 while CEO pay went up by $1,827,000.1<br><br> Image Over the past four years, from 2001 to 2005, America has lost 2,818,000 manufacturing jobs. If you don&#x2019;t count jobs produced by the military-industrial complex, the number of private sector jobs created since 2001 has decreased by 1,160,000.2<br><br> Image Although 67 percent of large employers (more than 500 employees) offer a traditional pension, that is down from 91 percent two decades ago, and it&#x2019;s dropping fast as more companies freeze pensions and turn instead to 401(k)s.3 Only 6 percent of Americans working in the private sector can rely on a defined pension,4 and 76 percent of Baby Boomers say they don&#x2019;t think they are very prepared to meet their retirement expenses.5<br><br> Image Today only 60 percent of employers provide health care to their employees. More than 45 million Americans were without health insurance as of 2004, and we can only guess that that number has grown.6<br><br> You don&#x2019;t need the numbers because you probably already know someone who has been forced out of the middle class. Roger, for instance, who once was a vice president of research and development for a software engineering company, lost his job during the dot-com bust and never got it back. After being unemployed for seven years, he&#x2019;s thinking of getting a job as a &#x201c;landscape engineer"&#x2014;that&#x2019;s a gardener&#x2014;at a tenth of his former salary.<br><br> Or there&#x2019;s the case of Bob, a college graduate who has been holding three jobs for the past five years, one full-time as a bookstore clerk, two part-time. Even though he works sixty hours a week, he doesn&#x2019;t make enough money to rent his own apartment (he rents a room in a shared flat) and he can&#x2019;t afford health insurance. He hopes his allergies don&#x2019;t turn into asthma because he can&#x2019;t afford the medication he would need for that.<br><br> Too many Americans are just holding on. Consider Amy: Divorced from her alcoholic husband, she has gone back to school full-time to become a teacher; she earns a living by catering on the weekends. A single mother, she and her daughter share a studio apartment. Amy has neither health insurance nor child care and no nearby relatives&#x2014;she relies on neighbors to take care of her daughter. One major illness and Amy would be homeless.<br><br> And then there are most of the rest of us, who have good jobs but still don&#x2019;t feel secure about the future. Ralph and Sally both get health insurance through their jobs, but their mortgage eats up more than 60 percent of their income, and the clothes and the necessities they buy for their two kids consume whatever might be left after groceries and utilities. They have health insurance but no pension. Their retirement is based on the few thousand dollars a year they can put into their IRAs. They wonder how they will be able to send their kids to college and afford to retire.<br><br> Today a man like my dad couldn&#x2019;t support a family of six on one paycheck. The middle class my dad belonged to is on its deathbed. Meanwhile, sitting around the pool, waiting for the dividend checks to roll in (while paying a maximum 15 percent income tax), the corporate class grows even wealthier.<br><br> How can this be?<br><br> How is it that companies could sell asbestos when they knew it would kill people? Why do people go hungry in America, the world&#x2019;s wealthiest nation? Why is it that people like you and me who work long, full days cannot afford to get sick, cannot buy houses, and cannot send their kids to college? What&#x2019;s happened to the middle class?<br><br> These questions are about our economy, but the answer is about who we are as a country.<br><br> DEMOCRACY AND THE MIDDLE CLASS<br><br> The most ancient form of democracy is found among virtually all indigenous peoples of the world. It&#x2019;s the way humans have lived for more than 150,000 years. There are no rich and no poor among most tribal people&#x2014;everybody is &#x201c;middle class.&#x201d; There is also little hierarchy. The concept of &#x201c;chief&#x201d; is one that Europeans brought with them to America&#x2014;which in large part is what produced so much confusion in the 1600s and 1700s in America as most Native American tribes would never delegate absolute authority to any one person to sign a treaty. Instead decisions were made by consensus in these most ancient cauldrons of democracy.<br><br> The Founders of this nation, and the Framers of our Constitution, were heavily influenced and inspired by the democracy they saw all around them. Much of the U.S. Constitution is based on the Iroquois Confederacy&#x2014;the five (later six) tribes who occupied territories from New England to the edge of the Midwest. It was a democracy with elected representatives, an upper and lower house, and a supreme court (made up entirely of women, who held final say in five of the six tribes).<br><br> As Benjamin Franklin noted to his contemporaries at the Constitutional Convention: &#x201c;It would be a very strange thing if Six Nations of Ignorant Savages should be capable of forming a Scheme for such an Union and be able to execute it in such a manner, as that it has subsisted Ages, and appears indissoluble, and yet a like union should be impracticable for ten or a dozen English colonies.&#x201d;<br><br> The Framers modeled the oldest democracies, and the oldest forms of the middle class, and thus helped create the truly widespread and strong first middle class in the history of modern civilization.<br><br> Back in Europe, however, the sort of democracy the Framers were borrowing and inventing, and even the existence of a middle class itself, was considered unnatural. For most of the seven thousand years of recorded human history, all the way back to the Gilgamesh Epic, the oldest written story, what we call a middle class is virtually unheard of&#x2014;as was democracy. Throughout most of the history of what we call civilization, an unrestrained economy and the idea of hierarchical social organization has always produced a small ruling elite and a large number of nearly impoverished workers.<br><br> Up until the founding of America, the middle class was considered unnatural by many political philosophers. Thomas Hobbes wrote in his 1651 magnum opus Leviathan that the world was better off with the rule of the few over the many, even if that meant that the many were impoverished. Without a strong and iron-fisted ruler, Hobbes wrote, there would be &#x201c;no place for industry . . . no arts, no letters, no society.&#x201d; Because Hobbes believed that ordinary people couldn&#x2019;t govern themselves, he believed that most people would be happy to exchange personal freedom and economic opportunity for the ability to live in safety and security. For the working class to have both freedom and security, Hobbes suggested, was impossible.<br><br> Our nation&#x2019;s Founders disagreed. They believed in the rights of ordinary people to self-determination, so they created a form of government where We the People rule. They declared that all people, and not just the elite, have the right to &#x201c;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&#x201d; (In that declaration, Thomas Jefferson replaced John Locke&#x2019;s famous &#x201c;life, liberty, and property&#x201d; with &#x201c;life, liberty, and happiness"&#x2014;the first time the word had ever appeared in the founding document of any nation.) They believed that We the People could create a country founded on personal freedom and economic opportunity for all. The Founders believed in the power of a middle class; and in defiance of Hobbes and the conventional wisdom of Europe, they believed that democracy and a middle class were the &#x201c;natural state of man.&#x201d;<br><br> As John Quincy Adams argued before the Supreme Court in 1841 on behalf of freeing rebelling slaves in the Amistad case, he stood before and pointed to a copy of the Declaration of Independence:<br><br> That DECLARATION says that every man is &#x201c;endowed by his Creator with certain inalienable rights,&#x201d; and that &#x201c;among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&#x201d; . . . I will not here discuss the right or the rights of slavery, but I say that the doctrine of Hobbes, that War is the natural state of man, has for ages been exploded, as equally disclaimed and rejected by the philosopher and the Christian. That it is utterly incompatible with any theory of human rights, and especially with the rights which the Declaration of Independence proclaims as self-evident truths.<br><br> It turns out that the Founders knew something Hobbes didn&#x2019;t know: political democracy and an economic middle class is the natural state of humankind. Indeed, it&#x2019;s the natural state of the entire animal kingdom.<br><br> For example, biologists used to think that animal societies were ruled by alpha males. Recent studies, however, have found that while it&#x2019;s true that alpha males (and females, in some species) have the advantage in courtship rituals, that&#x2019;s where their power ends. Biologists Tim Roper and L. Conradt discovered that animals don&#x2019;t follow a leader but instead move together.7<br><br> James Randerson did a follow-up study with red deer to prove the point.8 How does a herd of deer decide it&#x2019;s time to stop grazing and go toward the watering hole? As they&#x2019;re grazing, various deer point their bodies in seemingly random directions, until it comes time to go drink. Then individuals begin to graze while facing one of several watering holes. When a majority of deer are pointing toward one particular watering hole, they all move in that direction. Randerson saw instances where the alpha deer was actually one of the last to move toward the hole rather than one of the first.<br><br> When I interviewed Tim Roper about his research at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom, he told me that when his findings were first published, scientists from all over the world called to tell him that they were seeing the same thing with their research subjects. Birds flying in flocks aren&#x2019;t following a leader but monitoring the motions of those around them for variations in the flight path; when more than 50 percent have moved in a particular direction&#x2014;even if it&#x2019;s only a quarter-inch in one direction or another&#x2014;the entire flock &#x201c;suddenly&#x201d; veers off that way. It&#x2019;s the same with fish and even with swarms of gnats. Roper said that his colleagues were telling him that from ants to gorillas, democracy is the norm among animals. Just like with indigenous human societies&#x2014;which have had hundreds of thousands of years of trial and error to work out the best ways to live&#x2014;democracy is the norm among animals, and (other than for the Darwinian purpose of finding the best mate) hierarchy/kingdom is the rarity.<br><br> Thus, we discover, this close relationship between the middle class and democracy is burned into our DNA&#x2014;along with that of the entire animal kingdom (an ironic term, given this new informa...</p><h2>In the Dark Before Dawn: New Selected Poems</h2><p><b>A new, broad, comprehensive view of the innovative poetry of the late, great Trappist monk and religious philosopher Thomas Merton.</b> Poet, Trappist monk, religious philosopher, translator, social criticthe late Thomas Merton was all these things.

A voracious reader, Lincoln spent every spare moment of his days filling his mind with knowledge, from history to literature to mathematics, preparing himself to one day lead the country he loved towards greater equality and prosperity. <br><br>Despite the obstacles he faced as a self-educated man from the back woods, Lincoln persevered in his political career, and his compassion and honesty gradually earned him the trust of many Americans. As president, he guided the nation through a long and bitter civil war and penned the document that would lead to the end of slavery in the United States.<br><br>The passion for humanity that defined Lincoln's life shines through in this momentous follow-up to <i>Martin's Big Words</i> and <i>John's Secret Dreams</i>. Told in Doreen Rappaport's accessible, absorbing prose, and brought to life in powerful illustrations by Kadir Nelson, <i>Abe's Honest Words</i> is an epic portrait of a truly great American president.</p><p>Doreen Rappaport has written numerous award-winning books for children, including: <i>Freedom Ship </i>and <i>The School Is Not White (</i>both illustrated by Curtis James); <em>Martin's Big Words: The Life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</em>, a Caldecott Honor Book and Coretta Scott King Honor Book; and <i>John's Secret Dreams: The Life of John Lennon</i>, also illustrated by Bryan Collier. She lives and writes in upstate New York.<br>Kadir Nelson is the illustrator of many books for children, including <i>Moses: When Harriet Tubman Led Her People to Freedom</i> by Carole Boston Weatherford, an NAACP Image Award winner, a Caldecott Honor Book, and a Coretta Scott King Illustrator Award winner; <i>Ellington Was Not a Street</i> by Ntozake Shange, a Coretta Scott King Illustrator Award winner; <i>Please, Baby, Please</i> and <i>Please, Puppy, Please</i><i>, </i>by Spike Lee and Tonya Lewis Lee; and Will Smith's <i>Just the Two of Us</i><i>,</i> also an NAACP Image Award winner. He is also the author/illustrator of <i>We Are the Ship: The Story of Negro League Baseball</i>.<br>This collaboration between Rappaport and Nelson provides a sweeping arc of Lincoln's life, jumping from his humble beginnings and his early political career through his struggles to preserve the union and to help abolish slavery. Rappaport writes in a very free verse, and on each page echoes her narrative with prescient samplings of Lincoln's words. In the generously sized artwork that fills three quarters of each fold, Nelson makes the familiar face frowning out at us from various currencies exciting again, showing deep furrows and wearied creases, and on the few occasions when Lincoln falls prey to looking like a wooden statue, it is the faces of the people who surrounding him, watching him and judging him, that carry the weight of the artwork's impact. Nelson has the uncanny ability to telegraph a full range of emotion in the faces, especially in the eyes of his subjects, and it is in these details that he displays the true immensity of his talent. Minimally, his work is compelling; at best, it's spellbinding. This exceptional art, along with Rappaport's and Lincoln's words, makes this a fine celebration of a man who needs little introduction. Booklist"<br><br>With language as lean as our sixteenth president, Rappaport brings to light the major influences on and turning points in Lincoln's life. Excerpts from Lincoln's own speeches (although the sources are not uniformly acknowledged) ground these highlights-the death of his mother, his unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate, his fight against slavery, and his two inaugurations. Big events, such as the Emancipation Proclamation, receive eloquent quotes ("In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free..."). But other aspects of Lincoln's life, such as his constant reading ("He had just a mite of schooling, yet he loved words the way his papa, a master storyteller, did"), are punctuated with plainer speech ("The things I want to know are in books; my best friend is the man who'll git me a book I ain't read"). Some of Nelson's handsome portraits glow with background light and luminous skin tones, evoking the remote majesty of the statue at the Lincoln Memorial. At other times, he lets Lincoln walk down those stairs and portrays an unassuming man reading under a tree or cajoling political leaders with a story or two. An appended timeline fills in some facts of Lincoln's biography; recommended readings, a bibliography, and the text of the Gettysburg Address complete the book. Horn Book"<br><br>Rappaport plainly explicates the major events in Abraham Lincoln's life from his poor beginnings to the assassin's bullet. Her explanations of Lincoln's intellectual and social condemnation of slavery, and that condemnation's increasing influence on his decisions as President, arguably rank among the clearest in nonfiction for this age group (although as compressed as most): "The Emancipation Proclamation freed slaves only in the states and territories that were in rebellion. Lincoln wanted slavery ended in the entire nation." A design companion to Martin's Big Words (2001), Nelson's compelling illustrations, worked in a palette of umber, ochre, red and blue, epically render such scenes as the suffering of enslaved field workers, and Lincoln towering above the crowd at Gettysburg. By placing the viewer virtually at ground level in relation to the picture plane, Nelson evokes the heroism inherent in his compositions' central figures. Regrettably, the failure to contextualize the Lincoln quotations sprinkled throughout diminishes the historical verisimilitude of this otherwise remarkable achievement.

If you&#39;re like many believers, you long to pray better, to shake off your dullness of spirit and encounter God more intimately. You want to pray with the courage of Abraham, to beseech God with the courage Moses, but.... There are many examples in the Bible of men and women who prayed fervent, effective prayers that God answered. That&#39;s the question: What kinds of prayers does God answer? What kind of faith does God respond to? This book examines in considerable depth eleven amazing prayers. Some are short, others lengthy, but each has something important to teach us. You&#39;ll study key prayers of Jesus, Paul, Moses, Abraham, David, Hezekiah, Daniel, and Nehemiah. The aim of this study is to help you develop in prayer, increase your faith, and move you into a new plane of communication with your Father in heaven. However, this is not a course in learning to manipulate God to get your way. It is a study of who God is and how He responds to his children&#39;s petitions. Thus it will help you adopt His own heart as you petition your Father. As you model your prayers and your faith after the exemplars put before you in God&#39;s holy Word, you&#39;ll gradually learn to take your place as one of Jesus&#39; disciples whose prayers move heaven and earth. The book contains 11 lessons that can be used for personal enrichment and by small groups and classes. Preachers and teachers will also find a lot of their word study research done for them, with a number of illustrations and insights for lessons and sermons.</p><p></p><h2>A Dollhouse to Die For (A Deadly Notions Mystery)</h2><p><i>Daisy Buchanan thinks of her shop, Sometimes a Great Notion, as more than just a business.

As they shelter at a deserted ranch, the drought is broken and they linger, tending cattle for the absentee ranch owner, until the onset of another drought forces them to move on, homeless wanderers again. Yet, like the desert plants that defeat all rigors of wind and weather, the family maintains its will to survive in the harsh and solitary land. Intimately acquainted with the region of which he writes and keenly appreciative of the character of its inhabitants, into whose minds he has penetrated as few before him, Graciliano Ramos depicts them in a style whose austerity well becomes the spareness of the subject, creating a gallery of figures that rank as classic in contemporary Brazilian literature.</p></p><p>"Graciliano Ramos is of the naturalistic tradition in the literature of Brazil, but this novel is not mere social protest. The author has a keen visual sense, and the reader becomes one with the part of the earth where Fabiano&#x2019;s life unfolds.... Barren Lives is a moving novel, one to ponder on." (<i>Library Journal</i>)</p><h2>Uncollected Poems: Bilingual Edition</h2><p><p>Between the <i>New Poems</i> of 1907 and 1908 and his death in 1926, Rainer Maria Rilke published only two major volumes of poetry--the <i>Duino Elegies</i> and the <i>Sonnets to Orpheus</i>, both in 1923. But during this period he was writing verse continually, often prolifically--in letters, in guest books, in presentation copies, and chiefly in the pocket-books he always carried with him. This body of uncollected work exceeds five hundred pieces: finished poems of great poise and brilliance, headlong statements that hurtle through their subjects, haunting "fragments," and short bursts that arc into the unpursuable. A remarkable number of them are among Rilke's finest poems.</p><p>Snow's selection of more than a hundred of these little-known works distills the best of the uncollected poetry while offering a wide enough choice to convey Rilke's variety and industry during the years he wrote them. <i>Uncollected Poems</i> will lead students, scholars, and other readers to a fresh--and more accurate--understanding of this great poet's life and work.</p></p><p>Edward Snow has done the poetry-reading world a tremendous service in translating and collecting these previously obscure pieces of Rainer Maria Rilke&#39;s. The poems were written late in Rilke&#39;s career, and continue his lifelong concerns with the deepest and subtlest questions of being. Beautiful and lyrical writing fills these pages, as in this untitled poem, written in Paris in March, 1913: &#34;We don&#39;t know what we spend: / all that&#39;s named is past and each being / invents itself at the last second / and will hear nothing ...&#34;<p><b>Edward Snow</b> has received the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award and the PEN Award for Poetry in Translation for his many renderings of Rilke.

He has been acclaimed &#x201c;by far the most exciting writer to come from south of the Rio Grande in a long time&#x201d; (Ilan Stavans, <em>The Los Angeles Times</em>),&#x201d; and as &#x201c;the real thing and the rarest&#x201d; (Susan Sontag). Among his many prizes are the extremely prestigious Herralde de Novela Award and the Premio R�mulo Gallegos. He was widely considered to be the greatest Latin American writer of his generation. He wrote nine novels, two story collections, and five books of poetry, before dying in July 2003 at the age of 50.</p><p><b>Laura Healy</b> has received a Master&#x2019;s in Spanish from Harvard.

Bolano had one of 20th-century literature&#x2019;s great dirty minds, and many of this volume&#x2019;s best lines are unpublishable here.... A handful of these poems are something akin to sly masterpieces.... The sound <em>The Unknown University</em> mostly makes is that of a promising young writer seeking his way in the world of words.... Bolano was hungry, this book reminds you, for just about everything.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dwight Garner, <em>The New York Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>The Unknown University</em>, a new anthology of Bolano's poetry, reads like a series of fragments from a diary of this epic artistic journey. It's a book filled with sorrows and joys and discoveries as Bolano the poet takes up themes that are repeated often in his novels. For him, writers are men and women engaged in a sacred search, with poets the purest seekers of all. It's a pursuit that's all the more noble, given that Bolano knows that the immortality writers seek is unattainable.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Los Angeles Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;It is his earliest work published in English to date, and fans of <em>The Savage Detectives</em> will hope to find in it some hints of what the real Visceral Realist poetry was like.... It is a testament to Bolano&#x2019;s fundamental artistic honesty that buried here, in his own long-lost notebook, we find Ces�rea Tinajero&#x2019;s poem/drawing, written twenty years earlier.

Today it is a celebration of the the sport and women&#x2019;s advancement, an amusing manifesto, and a practical guide with timeless, eternally useful advice.</b></p><p>A member of the Staten Island Bicycle Club and master of mechanics, Maria E. Ward let the social norms and gendered expectations of the nineteenth century eat her dust when she wrote her groundbreaking guide to bicycling for women. Bent on inspiring other women to embrace the freedom of the open road, Ward pushed past the Victorian trappings of femininity to learn and share everything she could about the novel mode of transportation. In chapters such as Women and Tools, Dress, and How to Make Progress, she carefully explains the function of wheels, gears, and spokes, gives instruction on how to safely and efficiently ride, and discusses optimal attire (layers and a stretchy corset, of course).</p><p>Over 45 million women rode on a bicycle in 2018 and never before has a mode of transportation offered so much in terms of health benefits, environmental benefits, and autonomy, and women&#x2019;s advancement deserves to be celebrated. But the urgency of Ward&#x2019;s message lives on: male bicyclists still outnumber female riders, and most competitive cyclists are male. Decades ago, Ward knew that bicycling was &#x201c;within the reach of nearly all,&#x201d; regardless of class or gender and that it would offer social and economic mobility for women riders. Today, Ward&#x2019;s text is essential reading for the fearless woman looking to finally claim her stake of the road.</p><p>Complete with antique photographs from one of America&#x2019;s earliest and most prolific professional female photographers, Alice Austen, and illustrations from the original nineteenth century edition, <i>Bicycling for Ladies</i> has an elegant new design and is small enough to take on the go. For seasoned cyclists or those just starting out, <i>Bicycling for Ladies</i> serves as a timeless and relevant directive; it is for today&#x2019;s woman who&#x2019;s ready to take the world by the handlebars.</p></p><p><p><b>Maria E. Ward</b>, known by her nickname Violet, was an avid bicyclist, the cofounder of the Staten Island Bicycling Club, and the author of <i>Bicycling for Ladies</i>. Ward was born in Manhattan, New York, the daughter of General William Ward and Daisy Elliot, a teacher of calisthenics, and later lived in Staten Island with her parents and sister, Caroline. She cofounded the Staten Island Bicycle Club with her friend, the acclaimed photographer Alice Austen, in 1895, and Austen&#x2019;s photographs were used as references for the illustrations in <i>Bicycling for Ladies</i>, originally published by Brentano&#x2019;s in 1896. A wealth of photographs of Ward can be found in the Alice Austen photograph collection, which, along with letters and photographs from the Ward family archives, is in the possession of the Staten Island Historical Society.</p> <p>Ward has been widely celebrated for her contribution to the bicycling world in a wealth of media, including the May 2019 <i>New York Times </i>article &#x201c;Bicycle Diaries: Two Centuries of New York City History,&#x201d; the <i>Bust </i>magazine article &#x201c;First The Bicycle, Next The Vote: The Story Of Bicycles And Feminism,&#x201d; the book <i>Mothers and Daughters of Invention</i>, and <i>Momentum Mag</i>, which called her one of the three women &#x201c;who changed the course of history on bicycles.&#x201d; Ward died in 1941 at the age of seventy-eight.</p></p><h2>The Great God Pan And The Hill Of Dreams</h2><p><i>The Great God Pan</i> is a novella written by Arthur Machen. On publication it was widely denounced by the press as degenerate and horrific because of its decadent style and sexual content, although it has since garnered a reputation as a classic of horror. Machen's story was only one of many at the time to focus on Pan as a useful symbol for the power of nature and paganism.<br> <i>The Hill of Dreams</i> is a semi-autobiographical novel by Arthur Machen. Generally thought to be Machen's greatest work, it was little noticed on its publication in 1907 save in a glowing review by Alfred Douglas. It was actually written between 1895 and 1897 and has elements of the style of the decadent and aesthetic movement of the period, seen through Machen's own mystical preoccupations.</p><p></p><h2>A Murder Hatched: Murder with Peacocks and Murder with Puffins, the First Two Books in the Meg Langslow Series (Meg Langslow Mysteries) (NO. 1)</h2><p><p>Catch the first two books in Donna Andrews's award-winning laugh-out-loud Meg Lanslow series: this ebook bundle contains <i>Murder with Peacocks </i>and <i>Murder with Puffins</i>. </p><p>From ducks to penguins to peacocks to parrots, Donna Andrews knows her birds!

As far as Samantha was concerned, the entire universe revolved around her upcoming wedding, and as maid of honor, I was expected to share her obsession. &#x201c;I see,&#x201d; I said, although actually I didn&#x2019;t. I suppressed a shudder at the thought of peacocks, roasted with the feathers still on, gracing the buffet table. Surely that wasn&#x2019;t what she had in mind, was it? &#x201c;What are we going to do with them at the wedding?&#x201d; &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not going to do anything with them&#x201d; Samantha said, impatiently. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll just be there, adding grace and elegance to the occasion. Don&#x2019;t you remember the weekend before last when we all had dinner with your father? And he was saying what a pity it was that nothing much would be blooming in the yard in August, so there wouldn&#x2019;t be much color? Well, I just saw a photo in a magazine that had peacocks in it, and they were just about the most darling things you ever saw &#x2026;&#x201d; I let her rattle on while I fumbled over the contents of my bedside table, found my notebook-that-tells-me-when-to-breathe, flipped to the appropriate page, and wrote &#x201c;Peacocks&#x201d; in the clear, firm printing I use when I am not in a very good mood. &#x201c;Were you thinking of buying or renting them?&#x201d; I asked, interrupting Samantha&#x2019;s oration on the charms of peacocks. &#x201c;Well&#x2014;rent if we can. I&#x2019;m sure Father would be perfectly happy to buy them if necessary, but I&#x2019;m not sure what we would do with them in the long run.&#x201d; I noted &#x201c;Rent/buy if necessary&#x201d; after &#x201c;Peacocks.&#x201d; &#x201c;Right. Peacocks. I&#x2019;ll see what I can turn up.&#x201d; &#x201c;Wonderful. Oh, Meg, you&#x2019;re just so wonderful at all this!&#x201d; I let her gush for a few more minutes. I wondered, not for the first time, if I should feel sorry for Rob or if he was actually looking forward to listening to her for the rest of his life. And did Rob, who shared my penchant for late hours, realize how much of a morning person Samantha was? Eventually, I managed to cut short her monologue and sign off. I was awake; I might as well get to work. Muttering &#x201c;Peacocks!&#x201d; under my breath, I stumbled through a quick shower, grabbed some coffee, and went into my studio. I flung open all the windows and gazed fondly at my unlit forge and my ironworking tools. My spirits rose. For about ten seconds. Then the phone rang again. &#x201c;What do you think of blue, dear?&#x201d; my mother asked. &#x201c;Good morning, Mother. What do you mean, blue?&#x201d; &#x201c;The <i>color</i> blue, dear.&#x201d; &#x201c;The color blue,&#x201d; I repeated, unenlightened. I am not at my best before noon. &#x201c;Yes, dear,&#x201d; Mother said, with a touch of impatience. &#x201c;What do I think of it?&#x201d; I asked, baffled. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s a lovely color. The majority of Americans name blue when asked their favorite color. In Asian cultures&#x2014;&#x201d; &#x201c;For the living room, dear.&#x201d; &#x201c;Oh. You&#x2019;re getting something blue for the living room?&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m redoing it, dear. For the wedding, remember? In blue. Or green. But I was really leaning to blue. I was wondering what you thought.&#x201d; What I thought? Truthfully? I thought my mother&#x2019;s idea of redoing the living room for the wedding had been a temporary aberration arising from too much sherry after dinner at an uncle&#x2019;s house. And incidentally, the wedding in question was not Rob&#x2019;s and Samantha&#x2019;s but her own. After the world&#x2019;s most amiable divorce and five years of so-called single life during which my father happily continued to do all her yard work and run errands for her, my mother had decided to marry a recently widowed neighbor. And I had also agreed to be Mother&#x2019;s maid of honor. Which, knowing my mother, meant I had more or less agreed to do every lick of work associated with the occasion. Under her exacting supervision, of course. &#x201c;What sort of blue?&#x201d; I asked, buying time. The living room was done entirely in earth tones. Redoing it in blue would involve new drapes, new upholstery, new carpet, new everything. Oh, well, Dad could afford it, I suppose. Only Dad wouldn&#x2019;t be paying, I reminded myself. What&#x2019;s-his-name would. Mother&#x2019;s fiance. Jake. I had no idea how well or badly off Jake was. Well, presumably Mother did. &#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t decided, dear. I thought you might have some ideas.&#x201d; &#x201c;Oh. I tell you what,&#x201d; I said, improvising. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll ask Eileen. She&#x2019;s the one with the real eye for color. I&#x2019;ll ask her, and we&#x2019;ll get some color swatches and we&#x2019;ll talk about it when I come down.&#x201d; &#x201c;That will be splendid, Meg dear. Well, I&#x2019;ll let you get back to your work now. See you in a few days.&#x201d; I added &#x201c;Blue&#x201d; to my list of things to do. I actually managed to put down my coffee and pick up my hammer before the phone rang a third time. &#x201c;Oh, Meg, he&#x2019;s impossible. This is just not going to work.&#x201d; The voice belonged to my best friend and business partner, Eileen. She with the eye for colors. The he in question was Steven, since New Year&#x2019;s Eve her fiance, at least during the intervals between premarital spats. At the risk of repeating myself, I should add that I was, of course, also Eileen&#x2019;s maid of honor. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t want to include the Native American herbal purification ceremony in the wedding.&#x201d; &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; I said, after a pause, &#x201c;perhaps he feels a little self-conscious about it. Since neither of you is actually Native American.&#x201d; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s silly. It&#x2019;s a lovely tradition and makes such an important statement about our commitment to the environment.&#x201d; I sighed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll talk to him,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Just one thing &#x2026; Eileen, what kind of herbs are we talking about here? I mean, we&#x2019;re not talking anything illegal, are we?&#x201d; &#x201c;Oh, Meg.&#x201d; Eileen laughed. &#x201c;Really! I have to go, my clay&#x2019;s ready.&#x201d; She hung up, still laughing merrily. I added &#x201c;Call Steven re herbs&#x201d; to my list. I looked around the studio. My tools were there, ready and waiting for me to dive into the ironwork that is both my passion and my livelihood. I knew I really ought to get some work done today. In a few days, I would be back in my hometown for what I was sure would be a summer from hell. But I was already having a hard time concentrating on work. Maybe it was time to throw in the towel and head down to Yorktown. The phone rang again. I glared at it, willing it to shut up. It ignored me and kept on ringing. I sighed. and picked it up. Eileen again. &#x201c;Oh, Meg, before you go down to Yorktown, could you&#x2014;&#x201d; &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t have time to do anything else before I go down to Yorktown; I&#x2019;m going down there tomorrow.&#x201d; &#x201c;Wonderful! Why don&#x2019;t you stop by on your way? We have some things to tell you.&#x201d; On my way. Yorktown, where my parents and Eileen&#x2019;s father lived and where all the weddings were taking place, was three hours south of Washington, on the coast. Steven&#x2019;s farm, where Eileen was now living, was three hours west, in the mountains. I was opening my mouth to ask if she had any idea how inconvenient stopping by was when I suddenly realized: if I went to Steven and Eileen&#x2019;s, I could force them to make decisions, extract lists and signatures. I would have them in my clutches. This could be useful. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there for supper tomorrow.&#x201d; I spent the day putting my life on hold and turning over my studio to the struggling sculptor who&#x2019;d sublet it for the summer. I went to bed feeling virtuous. I intended to spend the next several days really getting things done for the weddings.

Yet each of the four elemental kingdoms offers great gifts to humanity, if we are willing to recognize that the psychological and spiritual qualities they embody are already inherent in human nature.<br><br>Mermaids dwell in the oceans, lakes, and rivers. They offer love and sharing, a sense of wonder, beauty, and innocence. Sylphs roam the sky; they represent harmony, balance, and the attainment of freedom. Gnomes live underground. Their quiet inner wisdom banishes depression and sorrow. Salamanders dwell in volcanoes and vast caverns of magma beneath the earth. They offer the power of intense heat to refine, transform, and integrate. Who are these mysterious creatures of water, air, earth, and fire? Author William Mistele has devoted a significant portion of his life to finding out.<br><br>Addressing the perennial questions Why are we here? What is the deepest purpose of life? What are our options?, <i>Mermaids, Sylphs, Gnomes, and Salamanders</i> takes the reader directly into the realms of these spirits, telling stories from their perspective. Weaving together fairy tales and poems, thoughtful analysis, and meditative exercises, Mistele illuminates the qualities these beings have mastered and humanity must begin to embrace: empathy, an inner peace with the universe, a divine level of sensuality, and a love that is everywhere in every moment.</p><p>After graduating from Wheaton College in Illinois with a BA in philosophy, William R. Mistele studied oral traditions from around the world, including Hopi Indian culture and language at the University of Arizona, where he received a master's degree in linguistics. Since 1975 he has been a student of Franz Bardon's teachings on Hermetic magic. He is the author of <i>Undines: Lessons from<br>the Realm of the Water Spirits</i>.&#x201c;This is a truly original book, written with great sensitivity, about an extraordinary subject.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Philip Carr-Gomm, author of <i>The Druid Way </i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In a world focused on material wealth and fame, there are few who have the dedication to explore the other realms and even fewer who bless us by sharing their experiences. In this book, William Mistele has done that, and at the same time he has shared much of himself.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;Martin Faulks, author of<b> </b><i>Secrets of Rejuvenation: Zen Warrior Exercises</i> in the Gateways to Health series<br><br> &#x201c;William Mistele brings Franz Bardon&#x2019;s elemental spirits to life in an elegant prose style.

Its brutality notwithstanding, the conflict was also threaded with tragicomedy: with Victorian hypocrisy, bureaucratic fumblings, military missteps, political opportunism and collaboration. Yet over the past hundred and seventy years, this strange tale of misunderstanding, incompetence and compromise has become the founding episode of modern Chinese nationalism.</p><p>Julia Lovell teaches modern Chinese history at Birkbeck College, University of London. She is the author of The Great Wall: China Against the World and The Politics of Cultural Capital: China&#39;s Quest for a Nobel Prize in Literature and writes on China for the Guardian, Independent and The Times Literary Supplement. Her many translations of modern Chinese fiction include, most recently, Lu Xun&#39;s The Real Story of Ah-Q, and Other Tales of China.&#x201c;A crisp readable account [Lovell] keeps a sharp plot running, which is a testament to her writing skills . . .

Now the poet is gone&#x2015;but the work lives, and sings.&#x201d; &#x2015;Robin Morgan</strong></p> This collection, 39 poems written between 1987 and 1992, is the final volume by "a major American poet whose concerns are international, and whose words have left their mark on many lives,&#x201d; in the words of Adrienne Rich. Audre Lorde (1934-1992) was the author of ten volumes of poetry and five works of prose. She was named New York State Poet in 1991; her other honors include the Manhattan Borough President&#x2019;s Award for Excellence in the Arts. <em>The Marvelous Arithmetics of Distance</em> was nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award in 1994.</p><p>Audre Lorde (1934-1992) published nine volumes of poetry and five works of prose.

Hills is wise, witty, and very, very funny. His mission is to create order out of chaos; to make the arcane methodology of fussiness respectable; to elevate, and even ennoble, those fleeting instincts we all harbor to get our lives in order. All aspects of life are examined here: from how to eat an ice-cream cone to how to develop &#34;principles&#34; when you have none. But behind the frivolous facade, Hills remains a deeply sage and serious writer, a modern combination of Robert Benchley, Henry David Thoreau, and Michel de Montaigne. This is his best advice, served up from the heart of one of the most charming humorists to grace the American scene.</p><p>"A perfectly wonderful book...It is much harder to be funny than to be tragic, but you will find damn few people who will acknowledge this. The funnier you become, the more lightly people will regard you. May you become as light as helium." --Kurt Vonnegut (from a letter to Rust Hills)<br><br>"Hills is preoccupied primarily [with] the little things...and he writes about them as felicitously, delicately, and gently as Benchley did." --Nora Ephron, The New York Times</p><h2>Five Children and It (Dover Children&#39;s Evergreen Classics)</h2><p>Be careful what you wish. You may get it! That s the message writer Edith Nesbit clearly imparts in this delightful tale of five youngsters who encounter a bizarre creature. This old-fashioned story recounts the adventures of children who go out to play one day, intending to dig a hole to the other side of the world to see if people walk upside down. They don t get very far before they meet an ancient sand fairy. Obliged to grant their wishes (because that s what sand fairies do), this curious looking, furry brown quadruped with bat s ears warns them that there is a catch: the wishes come undone at sunset. An enchanting tale of the ability of children to believe things that are beyond belief. Recommended by Laura Berquist Syllabus Grade 3 Author: E. Nesbit Format: 160 pages, paperback Publisher: Dover ISBN: 0486423662</p><p>The five children find a cantankerous sand fairy or &#39;psammead&#39; in a gravel pit. Every day &#39;It&#39; will grant each of them a wish that lasts until sunset, often with disastrous consequences. Five Children and It was first published in 1902, and it has remained in print ever since. The Introduction to this edition examines Nesbit&#39;s life and her reading, showing how she was poised between the Victorian world and a new era in which children in literature were no longer mere projections of the adult viewpoint. Sandra Kemp examines how the narrative is structured around the acting out of literary fantasies, which always come down to earth. Nesbit combines wonderfully implausible events with the prosaic and familiar, and Kemp illuminates her exploration of the shifting relationship between imagination, literature, and life.Edith Nesbit wrote more than 40 books for children, several of which have been adapted many times for film, including <i>Five Children and It </i>and <i>The Railway Children.</i> She is best known for her collections and re-tellings of classics such as <i>Stories from Shakespeare for Young Readers, </i>also available from Dover<i>.</i></p><h2>At the Heart of Christmas</h2><p><b><i>Hiring him could be her best idea.</i></b><br><b><i>Or her worst mistake.</i></b><br><p><br>Quinn has inherited the farm and workshop that once housed the famous Hardwick Ornament Company.

Isaac Bashevis Singer</p></p><p>The story takes place in what feels like a timeless, fairy-tale era of Europe, along the misty edges of Norwegian fjords, in ancient game-filled forests. As seems to be the case with the usual Hamsun hero, Lieutenant Thomas Glahn is a rather alienated guy, almost childlike in his innocence of the interpersonal politics between people in general, men and women in particular, and between him and Edvarda, the woman he falls in love with, most particularly.<b>Knut Hamsun</b> (1859-1952) was a Norwegian novelist, poet, and playwright.

Earth�s dubious allies, the Darhel, have given the humans a number of highly-advanced technological devices, including a process for rejuvenating the aged, including trained and proven soldiers who otherwise would be too old to fight. Rejuvenation may give a critical edge, since to survive, the Earth must use every resource at hand. <i>Every</i> resource . . . <br>In the dark days after the initial Posleen attack, but before the primary invasion, the Chancellor of Germany faces a critical decision. Over the years, with military cutbacks, the store of experienced German military personnel had simply dwindled. After the destruction of Northern Virginia, he realized that it was necessary to tap the one group he had sworn never, ever, to recall: the few remaining survivors of the Waffen SS. Has he made a devil�s bargain, or is this a chance for the reviled SS at last to fight the good fight? And, perhaps, gain redemption. . . ?<br><i>Watch On the Rhine</i>, a new chapter in the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling Posleen War saga, is perhaps the most unbiased, and brutal, look at the inner workings of the Waffen SS in history. Meticulously researched, it explores all that was good, and evil, about the most infamous military force in history using the backdrop of the Posleen invasion as a canvas.</p><p><b>John Ringo</b> is author of the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling Posleen War series which so far includes <i>A Hymn Before Battle</i>, <i>Gust Front</i>, <i>When the Devil Dances</i>, and <i>Hell�s Faire</i>, as well as the connected novels <i>Cally�s War</i> (with Julie Cochrane), <i>The Hero</i> (with Michael Z. Williamson), and <i>Watch on the Rhine</i> (with Tom Kratman), and is the hottest new science fiction writer since David Weber. A veteran of the 82nd Airborne, Ringo brings first-hand knowledge of military operations to his novels of high-tech future war. <br><b>Tom Kratman</b>, in 1974 at age seventeen, became a political refugee and defector from the PRM (People's Republic of Massachusetts) by virtue of joining the Regular Army. He stayed a Regular Army infantryman most of his adult life, returning to Massachusetts as an unofficial dissident while attending Boston College after his first hitch. Tom is currently an attorney practicing in southwest Virginia. Baen published his first novel, <i>A State of Disobedience</i> and will soon publish his second collaboration with John Ringo, <i>Yellow Eyes</i>.<i>Starred Review.</i> An axiom of military science is that an army reflects the society it protects, but what happens when that society is confronted with a crisis its dominant ideology can't solve? In this provocative addition to the Posleen War series, a galactic civilization genetically predisposed toward pacifism offers humanity advanced technology so that we can defend ourselves (and them) from the only other sentient species capable of violence&#x2014;think "Mongol horde in space." After the first enemy landings in 2004, the German chancellor decides, despite fierce opposition, to rejuvenate survivors of the Waffen SS. Eager to redeem their tarnished honor, these veterans display the same steadfastness and fortitude that they did in Russia and Normandy. Ringo (<i>Hell's Faire</i>) and Kratman (<i>A State of Disobedience</i>) pull no punches in this audacious and deliberately shocking effort, contrasting the ruthlessness of the (mostly) former Nazis with the contemporary politicians' disastrous insistence on forcing reality into a politically correct mold. Readers who can overcome their ideological gag reflex will be rewarded with an exciting view from "the other side of the hill." <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Considering the way capitalism has changed and evolved over the centuries, and what has remained constant, he outlines its chief characteristics. In particular, he looks at the emergence and development of a world market, and of labor; in doing so, he argues that capitalism has brought about immiseration in the Global South. As long as they remain within a framework of world capitalism, Wallerstein concludes, the economic and social problems of developing countries will remain unresolved.<br><br><i>Historical Capitalism</i>, published here with its companion essay <i>Capitalist Civilization</i>, is a concise, compelling beginners&#x2019; guide to one of the most challenging and influential assessments of capitalism as a world-historic mode of production.</p><p>In this short, highly readable book Immanuel Wallerstein provides a condensation of the central ideas of his monumental study of capitalism as an integrated, historical entity: The Modern World-System. In developing an anatomy of capitalism over the past five centuries, Wallerstein traces those elements that have constantly changed and evolved, while giving equal attention to features of historical capitalism that have necessarily remained constant. Particular attention is focused on the emergence and development of a unified world market, and the concomitant international division of labour. Wallerstein argues forcefully, against the current of much contemporary opinion, that capitalism has brought about an actual, not merely relative, immiseration in the countries of the Third World. The economic and social problems of underdeveloped countries will remain unresolved as long as they remain located within a framework of world capitalism.<b>Immanuel Wallerstein</b> is director of the Fernand Braudel Center at the State University of New York.

This was part of his wider political strategy of uniting Prussia with the southern German states, excluding Austria. The war was an overwhelming Prussian victory, and King Wilhelm I was proclaimed Emperor of the new united Germany. The Second Empire collapsed and Napoleon III became an exile in Britain. In the peace settlement with the French Third Republic in 1871 Germany gained the eastern French provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, areas that were to provide a bone of contention for years to come.</p><p>This unique series studies every major war in history looking at all the aspects of war, from how it felt to be a soldier to the lasting impact of the conflict on the world around it.Dr Stephen Badsey is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of War Studies at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

At his parents&#x2019; separation he stayed with his mother, who was a friend of Flaubert. As a young man he was lively and athletic, but the first symptoms of syphilis appeared in the late 1870s. By this time Maupassant had become Flaubert&#x2019;s pupil in the art of prose. On the publication of the first short story to which he put his name, &#x2018;Boule de suif&#x2019;, he left his job in the civil service and his temporary alliance with the disciples of Zola at M�dan, and devoted his energy to professional writing. In the next eleven years he published dozens of articles, nearly three hundred stories and six novels, the best known of which are <b>A Woman&#x2019;s Life</b>, <b>Bel-Ami </b>and <b>Pierre and Jean</b>. He led a hectic social life, lived up to his reputation for womanizing and fought his disease. By 1889 his friends saw that his mind was in danger, and in 1891 he attempted suicide and was committed to an asylum in Paris, where he died two years later.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Mayo Chiki!

How then can we develop an inner sense of well-being and redefine our relationship to a world that seems unavoidably painful and unkind?<br> <br>Many have found a practical answer to that question in the teachings of Tibetan Buddhism.

In so doing, she invites readers to reconsider the meaning of &#x201c;emptiness&#x201d; and ask larger, deeper questions such as: how do people experience the world? How do we shape places and how do places shape us? Above all, what does it mean to experience that exhilarating effect known as Zen of the plains?</p><p>TYRA A.

Very few will experience the wilderness as Olstad has. It would take years of stamina, endurance, patience, and a willingness to seek enlightenment in any weather, day and night.

She expertly describes the relevance of diet to health and steers you toward whole foods and away from clever marketing claims that may be secretly sabotaging your weight-loss efforts. You'll learn useful strategies for how to eat out, enjoy special occasions, and indulge in a favorite treat without tipping the scale. <br>And because weight loss is about more than food, Dr. Young addresses the whole person-your mind-set, environment, habits, and life-through research-based advice. You'll learn how relationships, gratitude, self-compassion, and sleep patterns, for instance, can make a difference. Portion control outlives all fad diets because it isn't a diet.

Now David Clay Large gives a specific human face to this tragedy of bureaucratic inertia and ill will. In this masterpiece of Holocaust literature, Large tells the wrenching story of Max Schohl, a German Jew who in the years preceding World War II could not find a government that would allow his family to immigrate, despite wealth, education, business and family connections, a job offer from an American university, and herculean efforts by himself and his American relatives. After repeated but fruitless efforts to gain entry first to the United States, and then to Britain, Chile, and Brazil, Max died in Auschwitz, and his wife and daughters were sent to hard labor in Wiesbaden. Max left behind a unique collection of family letters and documents, which Large has brought together into a gripping, personal commentary on the evolution of the Holocaust in Europe and the hopelessly inadequate response from abroad.</p><p><b>David Clay Large</b>, Professor of History at Montana State University, is a specialist in modern German history. He is the author of <i>Where Ghosts Walked, Germans to the Front, Between Two Fires</i>, and <i>Berlin</i>. He lives in Bozeman, Montana, and San Francisco, California.Max Schohl's family, including his wife and two teenage daughters, fled Germany for Yugoslavia in 1940. As a Jew, Max was no longer permitted to live and work in his own country. In 1942, Schohl was deported to Auschwitz, where he died the following year. His wife and daughters were sent back to Germany to work as slave laborers. They survived and finally were able to emigrate to the U.S. after World War II. Schohl's youngest daughter, Kathe, now 79 and living in Charleston, West Virginia, provided Large with letters and other documents chronicling the family's efforts to escape. Much of the book is in the form of letters, many of them between Max Schohl and Rudolf Hess. Large describes Germany in the 1920s and 1930s by saying "What I try to do in this narrative is to attach a specific human face and voice to the otherwise bloodless record of political calculations and bureaucratic regulations." More clearly than many other books, Large's account depicts the tragic abandonment of the Jews by Western nations. <i>George Cohen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He worked as a musician, a radio announcer, a songwriter, and a newspaper columnist. His first novel,&nbsp;<i>The Goodnight Trail</i>, was a finalist for the Western Writers of America Medicine Pipe Bearer Award for best debut novel. He was also the author of the Sundown Rider series and the Border Empire series.<br><br><b>Marcus Galloway</b>&nbsp;is the author of numerous novels in the Ralph Compton series.<b>Chapter 1</b><p>Colorado,1886 </p><p>In his life, Paul Meakes had been plenty of things. When he was inclined to boast, he would mention his time spent as half a lawman working as a deputy for a marshal in Kansas. Those had been an exciting couple of months but hadn&#x2019;t amounted to much apart from riding on a few posses without ever being offered steady employment. He&#x2019;d had a few lucky strikes as a miner while panning in the rivers of Wyoming and California, but plenty of men had stories like those. During his younger days, he&#x2019;d been a trapper on the Nebraska plains skinning buffalo and dragging their hides from one trading post to another in search of the best price.</p><p>Paul didn&#x2019;t have much use for boasting anymore. Some years ago, he&#x2019;d worked a few cattle ranches and picked up odd jobs in mining camps on his way into the southeastern portion of Colorado. Once there, he&#x2019;d met a lovely little woman named Joanna and opened a little general store that stocked bits and pieces the locals weren&#x2019;t likely to find anywhere else. He kept one of the best-stocked selections of books in the county and was known throughout his town for the oddities displayed in his front window. Residents of Keystone Pass knew where to go for blankets, oats, shoes, or tools. When they wanted something to read, a newspaper from any of a number of bigger towns, or fashions left behind by merchants on their way to New York or San Francisco, they went to Meakes Mercantile.</p><p>Before long, Paul&#x2019;s little store had acquired something of a reputation throughout Colorado. Those in favor of his place regarded it as a haven for fine goods and intellectual delights. Those who weren&#x2019;t feeling so generous called the shop a dumping ground for yellow-back novels and wares from every snake oil salesman who&#x2019;d dared showed his face east of the Rockies. Either way, Paul made a decent living. He was a far cry from being rich, but he managed to keep his head above water when it came time to feeding his little family.</p><p>Joanna was a beautiful woman. Short and a bit stout in stature, she had stolen Paul&#x2019;s heart the instant he saw her smile. When he worked up the nerve to ask her to a dance, hold her in his arms, smell her soft blond curls, marriage was a foregone conclusion. She was a caring wife and patient mother.</p><p>Was.</p><p>Paul thought of her often, so his brief respite while arranging the books for sale in his store was nothing new. Neither was the pinch at the corner of his eyes or the grief that stabbed at his heart when he thought of her in terms of was or used to be. She&#x2019;d passed fourteen months ago. Fourteen months during which he&#x2019;d felt the passage of every single moment. The whole town missed her. Joanna was the sort of woman who took it upon herself to remember folks by name and ask about their young ones whenever they passed in the street. Paul, on the other hand, was more likely to nod to familiar faces in a friendly way without being overly enthusiastic about it. Without Joanna at his side, he was only left with silent nods from partial strangers.</p><p>For the most part, that suited Paul just fine. He&#x2019;d spent most of his life roaming from one spot to another, one job to another, surrounded by a fair number of other people or none at all. When he was alone, he enjoyed the silence. When he was part of a community, he knew it was only a matter of time before he&#x2019;d break away to become part of another. More than likely, folks remembered him fondly but not very often. Since he remembered them the same way, Paul was content to let things remain that way.</p><p>Whenever his spirits needed lifting, he only had to look at the faces of his two children. Abigail and David were both the spitting images of their mother, even though he&#x2019;d been told the nine-year-old boy bore a mighty large resemblance to his father. If he wanted to be reminded of himself, Paul would look into a mirror, so he chose to only see them for what they were and as fond reminders of his sweet Joanna.</p><p>Standing with a pile of books cradled in his arms, Paul hadn&#x2019;t realized he&#x2019;d been lost in his thoughts until it was pointed out to him by the young woman looking through a small stack of dresses that had arrived all the way from New Mexico earlier that week. She was in her early teens and a bit tall for her age. Long, light brown hair was braided and draped over one shoulder to display a yellow ribbon tied at the end. Rolling her eyes, she rooted through the clothing with exaggerated vigor and let out a pronounced sigh.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong now, Daddy?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>Paul shrugged and got back to stocking the bookshelf. &#x201c;Why does anything have to be wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re staring at me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because you&#x2019;re beautiful.&#x201d;</p><p>Abigail started to roll her eyes again but blinked and showed her father a smile instead. It was a halfhearted gesture, but it served its purpose well enough. &#x201c;Thank you for saying so.&#x201d;</p><p>After placing the last book upon its shelf, Paul walked over to the table displaying the store&#x2019;s most recently acquired articles of clothing and rubbed his daughter&#x2019;s shoulder. She was almost as tall as him even though she tended to stoop a bit to hide her height. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not just saying so. It&#x2019;s the truth.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the only one who thinks so.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I doubt that very much.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, well . . . thank you all the same.&#x201d;</p><p>Walking to the back of the store where a few crates had been opened, Paul said, &#x201c;I imagine you could corral any boy you wanted.&#x201d;</p><p>Another sigh from the girl was followed by a series of stomping steps that led to the front of the store. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to talk about this with you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about Michael Willis? Weren&#x2019;t you and Becky talking about him just the other day?&#x201d;</p><p>Even from her new spot behind the cash register, Abigail managed to shoot a terse glare all the way back to where Paul was retrieving some more books. &#x201c;You were spying on me and Becky?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You and Becky are almost always together and you talk quite a lot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that got to do with anything?&#x201d;</p><p>Paul gathered another armful of books and carried them to the shelf at the front of the store. Although he wouldn&#x2019;t have dropped one volume in the middle of a hurricane, he fretted with them as a way to avoid his daughter&#x2019;s critical eye. &#x201c;I have ears,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not filled with wax. I hear things.&#x201d; He also saw things, but he decided not to embarrass her with those details.</p><p>&#x201c;Becky&#x2019;s meeting me at Johansen&#x2019;s Bakery. Can I have some money?&#x201d; she asked while already poking a key to open the cash register.</p><p>&#x201c;Take fifty cents. Not a penny more.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d;</p><p>Sliding each book into place and taking his time in the process, Paul waited until he heard his daughter walking to the front door before saying, &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re still hungry, there&#x2019;s going to be a picnic after Sunday services.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not for two days,&#x201d; she pointed out. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not eating until then?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course we are. It&#x2019;s just that . . . most everyone will be there. The Willis family, for certain.&#x201d;</p><p>Abigail lingered at the door with her hand on the knob. She closed her eyes and pressed her lips into a tight line in an expression of anxiety dating all the way back to when she&#x2019;d been a baby worried about standing upright. &#x201c;Michael doesn&#x2019;t care if I&#x2019;m there or not.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you know that for a fact?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; When she finally looked over to her father to see his stern expression, Abigail sighed. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then you should go to that picnic and ask him to dance.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He should be the one to do the asking.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe he&#x2019;s shy,&#x201d; Paul said. &#x201c;Boys get shy too, you know. And it&#x2019;s not such a terrible thing to ask one to dance. Many of them even like it that way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure they do,&#x201d; she scoffed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s less work for them.&#x201d;</p><p>Paul laughed and fell into an easier rhythm of placing the books in their proper order. After taking a moment to lift one to his nose so he could smell the musty pages, he said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right about that, but it never hurts to meet someone halfway. If things go right, it won&#x2019;t hardly matter who took that first step.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess I could go to the picnic . . . if Becky&#x2019;s going too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the spirit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know what would make me feel better about going?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If I had a new dress to wear.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t agree more. Martha just sent over a few nice ones the other day,&#x201d; Paul told her. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re hanging next to those waistcoats.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was thinking more about the fancy silk ones on the front display.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I bet you were. Those will fetch a mighty good price, but not if they&#x2019;ve already been worn. They&#x2019;ll be damn near worthless once you spill jam or soup on them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t spill on it, Daddy!&#x201d; she insisted while coyly trying to shift her arms to hide the faded stain on the dress she now wore.</p><p>&#x201c;You spill on just about everything, sweetie. It&#x2019;s part of your charm.&#x201d;</p><p>Judging by the way she stormed out of the store, Abigail did not share that sentiment or find it half as endearing as her father did.<br><br><b>Chapter 2</b></p><p>Supper was a simple affair prepared hastily by Abigail and cleared away by her younger brother. David was a slender boy with fair hair, dark circles under his eyes, and long legs. When he was done washing the last of the dishes, David went out to the porch and approached his father, who stood enjoying the night.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m done with my chores, Pa,&#x201d; David said. &#x201c;Did you bring me anything from the store?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Some new books came in today,&#x201d; he said while puffing on a chipped pipe. Even though he didn&#x2019;t look over at David, he had no trouble picturing the boy&#x2019;s wide, expectant eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;I know them books came in!&#x201d; David squealed. &#x201c;You said you&#x2019;d bring me one!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did I?&#x201d;</p><p>The nine-year-old let out an all-too-familiar sound that was part groan and part whine. Before it could shift too far into the latter category, Paul said, &#x201c;Of course I brought you one! You think I&#x2019;d forget about my boy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, sir!&#x201d; David beamed.</p><p>Paul lowered himself onto a chair that had been left in the elements for so long that it had practically grown roots into the porch. It sagged beneath his weight and creaked with every shift of his body but showed no hint of breaking. It protested loudly when Paul reached around to pick up the thin volume he&#x2019;d set down where it could remain out of sight until now. When he held it out to the boy, he showed an expression that bore an uncanny resemblance to the one David had worn earlier.</p><p>Unfortunately David&#x2019;s expression didn&#x2019;t last very long. &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Did you bring any others?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Paul replied. &#x201c;I thought you&#x2019;d like that one. It&#x2019;s a ghost story.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ghosts are scary.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s just a story.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have nightmares,&#x201d; David said in a voice that was growing into more of a whine.</p><p>&#x201c;All right, then. I saw another one you might like.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really? Is it about trains?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. It&#x2019;s about an adventure in the jungles of Peru! That&#x2019;s where the conquistadores landed, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jungles are scary.&#x201d;</p><p>Paul drew a deep breath. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve never been to a jungle.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know. They&#x2019;re still scary.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just a story. Maybe if you read it, you&#x2019;ll enjoy it and then you won&#x2019;t be so scared about it anymore. That&#x2019;s how men become brave.&#x201d;</p><p>David nodded even though he&#x2019;d obviously stopped listening. Wincing slightly when Paul rubbed his arm, he said, &#x201c;I just like stories about trains. And horses. They&#x2019;re not so scary.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll look around for something along them lines when I go back to the store tomorrow,&#x201d; Paul said, even though he knew well enough that he&#x2019;d already set aside a story about a young Arabian thief who tames a wild stallion. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that . . . you&#x2019;re getting close to ten years old, son. There&#x2019;s no reason to be so squirrelly.&#x201d;</p><p>At least when David nodded this time, he seemed to be listening to what Paul was telling him. &#x201c;All right, Pa.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Will you help in the store tomorrow?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Last time I got hurt.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was just a sliver in your hand,&#x201d; Paul growled. &#x201c;Are you still crying about that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;N-no.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll help me in the store tomorrow and you&#x2019;ll come with me to pick up some new inventory on Monday.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But I got school on Monday!&#x201d; David said.</p><p>&#x201c;Not when your father needs an extra set of hands to load the wagon. You and your sister are coming along and that&#x2019;s that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Will I get paid for it?&#x201d;</p><p>Paul scowled at the boy and took hold of the front of David&#x2019;s shirt to give him a gentle shake. &#x201c;What am I gonna do with you? I&#x2019;ll pay you fifty cents but not a penny more. Deal?&#x201d;</p><p>Extending his hand so quickly that he almost threw out an elbow, David replied excitedly, &#x201c;Deal!&#x201d;</p><p>Father and son shook hands and enjoyed a nice couple of moments before David asked, &#x201c;What else can I do and get paid for it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go to bed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll pay me to go to bed?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Paul said in a strained voice. &#x201c;Just . . . go to bed. It&#x2019;s getting late.&#x201d;</p><p>David started walking into the house, stopped, and then turned around to approach his father again. He kissed Paul&#x2019;s forehead and then went inside.</p><p>Once he was certain he was alone on the porch, Paul started flipping through the book he&#x2019;d tried to give to David. Since it wasn&#x2019;t going to be put to any use at his house, he&#x2019;d take it back to the store in the morning. He could think of a few boys who would get a thrill out of the adventurous yarns. In fact, he was hard-pressed to think of a boy other than his own who wouldn&#x2019;t like it. Or perhaps he just didn&#x2019;t know children very well.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying, Joanna,&#x201d; he said quietly into the night sky. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying, but it surely ain&#x2019;t easy. I wonder if you would have an easier time with these two. Aw, who the hell am I kidding? Of course you would.&#x201d;</p><p>With that, Paul set the book down and crossed his arms over his full belly. He thought about inventory and numbers that had yet to be written into the ledger in his office. He thought about when the next traveling salesmen were due to roll through town and how much of a discount he could wheedle from them for a bulk purchase. As the steady current flowed through his head and a cool breeze touched his face, Paul started drifting to sleep.</p><p>Eventually his thoughts drifted toward the future. He&#x2019;d heard tell of a vein of gold that had barely been touched in a mine that was being sold for next to nothing. If he found a buyer for his store, he could cash in and possibly become rich after a few months of hard work. There were always ranchers looking for partners down in Texas or back in his old Kansas stomping grounds. Running a spread instead of working on one could set him up for life.</p><p>So many different trails to ride after leaving Keystone Pass.</p><p>So many destinies to chase.</p><p>Tomorrow.<br><br><b>Chapter 3</b></p><p>Despite the biblical origins of his name, Paul had never been much of a churchgoing man. His mother and father had dragged him to Sunday worship for most of his childhood, presumably as a way to cleanse his young soul or enrich his growing mind. He couldn&#x2019;t much speak to the success of the former, but the latter didn&#x2019;t seem to take very well. If not for Joanna, he probably would have avoided hearing another sermon for the rest of his days. She&#x2019;d been a truly joyful Christian. In Paul&#x2019;s experience those were a rare breed whose faith came f...</p></p><h2>Human Anatomy: A Visual History from the Renaissance to the Digital Age</h2><p>Praised by <i>Nature</i> ("stunning"), the <i>London Times</i> ("remarkable"), and the <i>Guardian</i> ("mesmeric"), this lavishly illustrated book chronicles the remarkable history of anatomical illustration. Before the invention of photography, artists played an essential role in medical science, recording human anatomy in startlingly direct and often moving images. Over 400 years, beginning with Vesalius, they charted the main systems of the body, made precise studies of living organs, documented embryonic development, and described pathologies. <i>Human Anatomy</i> includes portfolios of the work of 19 great anatomical artists, with concise biographies, and culminates with the Visible Human Project, which uses digital tools to visualize the human body.<br><br>Praise for <i>Human Anatomy:<br><br></i>"From Leonardo da Vinci's exquisite pen-and-ink drawings of the human skeleton to the digital Visible Human Project in its three-dimensional glory, this fascinating book . . . documents more than 500 years of anatomical illustration in living color."<br><i>&nbsp;-Scientific American </i></p><p><b>Benjamin A.

At the Battle of Kursk there were not enough Tigers to make a decisive difference and thereafter the Tiger was forced to play a mainly defensive role as the Wehrmacht struggled to withstand the advances of the Red Army. And it is this period in the Tiger tank&#x2019;s short history that Dennis Oliver concentrates on in this, his third book on the Tiger in the TankCraft series.<br><br>He uses archive photos and extensively researched color illustrations to examine the tanks and units of the German army&#x2019;s heavy panzer battalions. A large part of the book showcases available model kits and aftermarket products, complemented by a gallery of beautifully constructed and painted models in various scales. Technical details as well as modifications introduced during production and in the field are also examined providing everything the modeler needs to recreate an accurate representation of the Tigers of 1943.</p><p>Dennis Oliver is the author of over twenty books on Second World War armored vehicles.</p><h2>Healthy Pasta: The Sexy, Skinny, and Smart Way to Eat Your Favorite Food: A Cookbook</h2><p><p>Having grown up with Lidia Bastianich as their mother, Tanya and Joe Bastianich are no strangers to great-tasting Italian cooking.

When the oil is hot, add the pancetta and cook until the fat is rendered, about 4 minutes. Add the scallions and garlic and cook until the scallions are wilted, about 3 minutes.<br> &nbsp;<br> 2. Add the linguine to the boiling water. Once the pasta is cooking, add the peas and zucchini to the skillet and season with salt and red pepper flakes. Toss until the zucchini begin to wilt, about 2 minutes. Ladle in 1 cup pasta water and simmer and reduce by half while the pasta cooks.<br> &nbsp;<br> 3. When the pasta is al dente, remove it with a spider or small strainer and add directly to the sauce, along with the basil and parsley, reserving the pasta water.

In a large bowl, toss the mushrooms with � tablespoon of the olive oil and season with salt. Spread on one of the preheated pans. Repeat with the squash and the remaining olive oil and season with salt and the thyme. Spread on the second sheet pan and roast both until browned and tender, stirring and switching the pans from top to bottom halfway through the cooking time, about 20 minutes in all.<br> &nbsp;<br> 3. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. When the butter is melted, whisk in the flour to make a smooth paste. Let cook for 2 minutes to remove the raw flour smell, then whisk in the milk and chicken broth. Add the bay leaf and nutmeg and season with salt and red pepper flakes. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Discard the bay leaf.<br> &nbsp;<br> 4. Add the rigatoni to the boiling water. When the pasta is very al dente, several minutes shy of the package cooking time, drain and rinse. In a small bowl, toss the mozzarella and Grana Padano together. In a large bowl, combine the pasta, white sauce, and roasted vegetables and season with salt. Toss to coat the pasta with the sauce.<br> &nbsp;<br> 5. Pour into a 13 by 9-inch ceramic or glass baking dish. Sprinkle with the grated cheese mixture. Bake until the sauce is bubbly on the edges and the top is browned, 15 to 17 minutes.

An enthralling novel about love and treachery, joy after grief, and a man forced to ask: is it ever too late to seek forgiveness?</p><p>A screenwriter and novelist, <b>Natasha Solomons</b> lives in Dorset, England, with her husband and young son. She is the<i> New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The House at Tyneford, The Gallery of Vanished Husbands, </i>and <i>The Song of Hartgrove Hall.</i>March 2000<br> &nbsp;<br> Edie sang at her own funeral. &nbsp;It couldn&#x2019;t &nbsp;have been any other way. Most people first knew her by her voice. New acquaintances took a few weeks or months to reconcile that voice, that thrill of sound, with the slight, grey-eyed woman holding the large handbag. She was a garden thrush with the throat &nbsp;of a nightingale. It was one of her nicknames &#x2013; &#x2018;The Little Nightingale&#x2019; &#x2013; and the one I felt suited her best. The nightingale isn&#x2019;t quite who we think she is. Contrary to what most people believe, the nightingale isn&#x2019;t a British bird who winters &nbsp;in &nbsp;Africa. &nbsp;She&#x2019;s an &nbsp;African &nbsp;bird &nbsp;who &nbsp;summers &nbsp;in England, and the sought-after &nbsp;music of an English summer evening is really music from the African bush, as native to Guinea-Bissau as to the moss-sprung and anemone-speckled copses of Berkshire and Dorset.<br><br> Edie once told me that the English countryside never really made sense to her. Her tiny Russian grandmother had looked after her while her parents manned their stall in Brick Lane, and she used to tell Edie stories. In winter they&#x2019;d huddle under blankets beside the electric fire in their grotty flat, passing a cigarette back and forth, &nbsp;Edie listening, her Bubbe talking. Bubbe&#x2019;s stories were all of Russia and the white cold, a cold so deep it turned your bones to ice, and if the wind blew hard, you&#x2019;d shatter into a billion pieces, fluttering to the ground as yet more snow.<br> In summer Edie and Bubbe would take apples out to the scrap of green that passed for a park and sit on a tarpaulin square (for a woman &nbsp;raised in Siberia, Edie&#x2019;s grandmother was remarkably &nbsp;anxious &nbsp;about &nbsp;the ill effects of dew damp grass). On sun-filled afternoons, when grubby daisies unfurled&nbsp;in the warmth, young men unbuttoned their shirts to the navel and girls furtively unpeeled their stockings, Bubbe would tell stories full of snow. Edie would lie back and close her eyes against the jewel-gleam of the hot sun and envision snow racing across the grass in waves, turning everything white, smothering the sunbathers who had only a moment to shiver and scream before they shattered into ice.<br><br> It was rare for Edie to confide anything about &nbsp;her child- hood. She kept it close, self-conscious and uneasy under the barrage of my interest. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m not like you. It wasn&#x2019;t like this,&#x2019; she&#x2019;d say, gesturing to the house with its lobes of wisteria or at the trembling willows by the lake. I&#x2019;d feel embarrassed&nbsp; and overcome with a very British need to apologise for the quiet privilege of &nbsp;my own &nbsp;childhood, &nbsp;which, &nbsp;according &nbsp;to &nbsp;Edie, must have diminished any loss or sadness that dared intrude in such a place.<br><br> For all their charm, the gardens at Hartgrove &nbsp;never quite touched &nbsp;Edie. She admired &nbsp;the tumbles of &nbsp;violets, and the slender spring irises the colour of school ink, but she never troubled to learn the names of the flowers. I always had the gardener &nbsp;fill the pots &nbsp;on the terrace &nbsp;where we breakfasted with golden marigolds, so she insisted on calling them the marmalade flowers. It confused Clara sufficiently that, when she was about five, I caught her trying to spread the marma- lade flowers on her toast.<br><br> But when it snowed , Edie longed to be outdoors. &nbsp;She was more excited than the children. At the first flake, she&#x2019;d put on three coats at once, bandage her head in coloured scarves like a babushka and rush out, staring at the sky and willing a bliz- zard. Long after the girls were tired and damp from sledging in the fields, Edie lingered. Clara and Lucy would flop before the hearth in my study beside the steaming spaniels, and pres- ent to the fire rows of cold pink toes. Under the pretext of putting on a record for the girls (<i>The Nutcracker </i>or a swirling,&nbsp;cinnamon-sprinkled &nbsp;Viennese waltz &nbsp;&#x2013; our children&#x2019;s taste in music was as sugar-sweet as the candy they lusted after), from the window I&#x2019;d watch Edie as she&#x2019;d start towards &nbsp;the house and then pause every few steps, turning back to gaze at the white hills and the huddle of dark woods, like a lover reluctant to say a last goodbye.<br><br> So many people think they knew her. The Little Nightingale. England&#x2019;s perfect rose. But Edie didn&#x2019;t dream of roses in summertime, she dreamed of walking through snow, the first footsteps on an icy morning.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> November 1946<br> &nbsp;<br> Hartgrove Hall is ours again. It&#x2019;s a strange sensation, this supposed homecoming &#x2013; the prodigal sons returning all&nbsp;at once to Dorset on a bloody cold November morning. We are silent on the drive from the station to the house. Chivers steers the cantankerous &nbsp;Austin at a steady twenty miles per hour, the General parked beside him on the front seat abso- lutely upright as though off to inspect the troops, while Jack, George and I are jammed into the back, trying not to meet one another&#x2019;s eyes as we stare resolutely out of the windows.<br><br> I&#x2019;m nervous about seeing her again. Hartgrove Hall is our long-lost love, the pen pal we&#x2019;ve been mooning over in our thoughts for the last seven years, but each of us is submerged in lonely and silent anxiety at the prospect of our reunion. We know the house has had a tricky war &#x2013; a parade of British regiments followed by the Americans, all of them tenants with mightier preoccupations than pruning the roses or sweeping the drawing room chimney or halting the onslaught of death- watch &nbsp;beetle &nbsp;that &nbsp;has &nbsp;been &nbsp;gobbling &nbsp;through &nbsp;the &nbsp;rafters forever.<br><br> As the car creeps higher and into the shadow of the hill, hoarfrost is draped across the branches like banners and where the trees meet across the narrow &nbsp;lane, we plunge through &nbsp;a tunnel of silver and white. The car turns into the long drive- way and there she is, Hartgrove Hall, bathed in early morning haze. To my relief she&#x2019;s still the beauty I remember. I can&#x2019;t see her flaws through the kindly mist, only the buttery warmth of the stone front, the thick limestone slabs on the roof drizzled with yellowing lichen. I climb out of the car and absorb the multitude of high mullioned windows and the elegant slope&nbsp;of the porch, and out of childish habit suddenly recalled, I count the skulk of stone foxes from the family crest that are carved on the flushwork. Ivy half conceals the smallest fox, so that he pokes his snout out from amongst the leaves as if he&#x2019;s shy. I&#x2019;m frightfully glad to see him. I thought I&#x2019;d recalled every detail of the house. I&#x2019;d paced its walks and corridors &nbsp;each night before falling asleep and yet, already, here is something I&#x2019;d quite forgotten.<br><br> The yellow sandstone fa�ade is the same but the wisteria has been hacked away and without&nbsp; it the front looks naked. All of the windows are unlit and the house looks cold, unready for guests. We&#x2019;re not guests, I remind myself. We are the family returned. Yet it&#x2019;s an odd sort of homecoming: instead of Chivers or one of the maids lingering in the porch to welcome us, a major from the Guards waits on the front steps, stamp- ing his feet to keep warm. On seeing us, he stops abruptly and salutes the General. The major thanks him for his honourable sacrifice and generosity even though we all know it&#x2019;s bunkum and the house was requisitioned by law. Although, I suppose, knowing the General, he would have surrendered the house in any case out of a sense of duty. The General takes great pleas- ure in doing his duty. The more unpleasant the sacrifice, the more he enjoys it.<br><br> The major clearly wants to be off but Father keeps him talking outside for a good fifteen minutes while it starts to sleet. We all stand there rigid with cold and boredom. I&#x2019;m amazed that &nbsp;Jack &nbsp;doesn&#x2019;t &nbsp;declare, &#x2018;Bugger this, I&#x2019;m off &nbsp;to inspect the damage done to the old girl,&#x2019; and disappear, but then he and George have been demobbed for only a month or so. Beneath the civvy clothes they still possess a soldier&#x2019;s habits and to walk away from a senior officer wouldn&#x2019;t just be poor manners but a disciplinary offence.<br><br> After an age, the General allows the unfortunate &nbsp;major to depart &nbsp;and &nbsp;marches &nbsp;indoors. &nbsp;Jack, George and &nbsp;I hesitate,&nbsp;unwilling to follow. I want our reunion to be private and, as I glance at my brothers, it is clear that they feel the same. Jack lingers for a moment, then turns back down the steps, making for the river, while George heads in the opposite direction, crossing the lawns towards the lake. I wait for a minute, gulp- ing cold, fresh air, feeling the bite and tang of it on my teeth, and then slip into the house. The great hall is almost as frigid as it is outside. In the vast and soot-stained inglenook there is no fire. I am almost certain that there used to be a constant fire.&nbsp; The &nbsp;requisite &nbsp;carved &nbsp;foxes gaze out &nbsp;from &nbsp;the &nbsp;stone- carved struts, chilly and forlorn. I suppose there is no one to light a fire now and I don&#x2019;t suppose there will be again. I notice that &nbsp;the mantelpiece is missing. I can&#x2019;t think how it was taken or why.<br><br> The walls are bereft of paintings. The good ones haven&#x2019;t hung here for years. They were flogged, one Gainsborough and &nbsp;Stubbs at &nbsp;a &nbsp;time, &nbsp;but &nbsp;my ancestors &nbsp;were sentimental chaps. Until the army requisitioned the house, copies of the originals used to hang around the hall &#x2013; gloomy reminders of what was lost to Christie&#x2019;s to pay inheritance tax, veterinarian bills, servants&#x2019; wages and to replace rotting windows. Some of the copies were rather good, others less so &#x2013; peculiar, carni- val-mirror distortions of the originals. For years, Jack, George and I used to play &#x2018;spot the imposter&#x2019; and attempt &nbsp;to guess which of the bewigged and unsmiling portraits &nbsp;were copies. Then the General told us that none of them was real and the game was rendered pointless.<br><br> The last painting to go was a dear Constable landscape of the woodland beneath Hartgrove barrow. The painter stands at the top of the ridge, gazing down at a brown wood dabbed with autumn light. Somewhere in the painting a nightingale sings &#x2013; the last of the year. The copy of the Constable &nbsp;is quite decent. I&#x2019;ve always liked it, even though the colours are second rate and the lines muddy &#x2013; but I can still hear the nightingale and that&#x2019;s what matters. George sent it to me, along with his letter explaining that the house was to be requisitioned. &nbsp;I&#x2019;d been alone at school when the news had come, and it had left me disconsolate. Only George would have thought to send the painting with the horrid news &#x2013; a kind memento of home to sustain me. Inevitably the painted view began to supplant &nbsp;the one in my imagination &nbsp;until I began to see the barrow and woods third hand &#x2013; Constable&#x2019;s vision re-daubed by a copyist.<br><br> I return to the car, retrieve the picture from the boot and rehang it on a nail in the hall. It looks lost and small.<br><br> I&#x2019;m chilled and feel queasy from the pervasive stench of damp. Disheartened, I retreat down the steps and out across the &nbsp;tangle &nbsp;of &nbsp;gardens &nbsp;before &nbsp;striking &nbsp;uphill &nbsp;towards &nbsp;the ridge of Hartgrove barrow. I set off at a lick until, breathless from &nbsp;exertion, &nbsp;I pause &nbsp;at &nbsp;the &nbsp;first &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;grass &nbsp;terraces rippling the hillside to look down at the house. It&#x2019;s different for me than for the others. I was eleven when she was taken in &#x2019;39 and I don&#x2019;t remember how she&#x2019;s supposed to be, not with &nbsp;the &nbsp;absolute &nbsp;clarity &nbsp;of &nbsp;Jack &nbsp;or &nbsp;George. &nbsp;From &nbsp;my vantage point I can see the burned-out south wing. An acci- dent with an ember smouldering in an unswept chimney, according &nbsp;to &nbsp;the letter &nbsp;sent by the War &nbsp;Office, although Jack heard rumours it was a game gone awry in the Officers&#x2019; Mess. They&#x2019;d been bottling farts into brandy bottles &#x2013; such an ignominious end for four hundred years of history: sent up in smoke by a lit fart.<br><br> I&#x2019;m not surprised no one could face confessing the truth to the General. I spent much of the war evading him myself. Not that it took much effort &#x2013; the General&#x2019;s war was spent preen- ing in Whitehall, he was delighted to partake in another helping &nbsp;of &nbsp;battle &nbsp;even at &nbsp;a &nbsp;distance. Between school and&nbsp;holidays dawdled away at the houses of pals, I managed not to endure more than the occasional uneasy luncheon with him at the club.<br><br> From up here I can see the exposed timbers, looking like broken ribs, and the house appears unsteady and uneven, her former symmetry quite spoiled. An invalid with her shattered limb still attached. The lawns are sloshed into mud. Half the limes on the avenue are missing so that the driveway resembles a mouth with most of the teeth knocked out. The woodland under the ridge is balding in patches, where scores of the trees have been felled so that only the stumps remain, stubbling the hillside.<br><br> I sit down on an anthill and cry, relieved no one can see me. I wonder how the bloody hell we&#x2019;re going to put the old girl back together. There are no paintings left to flog. No forgot- ten Turner lurking in the attic. Canning, the aged and recalcitrant &nbsp;estate &nbsp;manager, &nbsp;is muttering &nbsp;about &nbsp;wanting &nbsp;to retire. But then I swat away my doubts and revel in the pleas- ure of home. I take a breath of cold, larch-spiced air. Happiness rises up through me, fierce as brandy fumes.</p><h2>Ghost Stories for Darwin: The Science of Variation and the Politics of Diversity</h2><p>In a stimulating interchange between feminist studies and biology, Banu Subramaniam explores how her dissertation on flower color variation in morning glories launched her on an intellectual odyssey that engaged the feminist studies of sciences in the experimental practices of science by tracing the central and critical idea of variation in biology.<br> &nbsp;<br> As she shows, the histories of eugenics and genetics and their impact on the metaphorical understandings of difference and diversity that permeate common understandings of differences among people exist in contexts that seem distant from the so-called objective hard sciences.

It's a great, intensely fun, quick read that satisfied my Dresden Files itch in a year during which I'm not sure we'll get a new novel in the series.&#x201d; - <i>Kirkus</i><br><br>A war is raging between the vampire forces of the Red Court and the White Council - a war that the wizards are losing. So desperate are the Council that they've dragooned the experienced and the outcast to reinforce their thinning ranks of Wardens. One of these draftees is one Harry Dresden, Chicago's only wizard-for-hire and a guy who's long been looked upon with suspicion by the supernatural authorities. Now, he's one of them, and his first big mission as a Warden is a doozy: take a small team of greenhorns to a frigid town in the middle of nowhere to rescue a handful of mortals who've been targeted by the Red Court. The question is, why exactly are these particular mortals so crucial to the outcome of the war? The answer will come only if Harry can keep them, and his team, alive for one very long night. <br><br> This graphic novel collects the critically acclaimed, five-issue series in one volume, and features a bonus section with Jim Butcher's original story outline, sketchbook artwork from Carlos Gomez, cover gallery with roughs from Stjepan Sejic, and more!<br><b>Creator Commentary from Jim Butcher</b>: "The greatest frustration about writing the <i>Dresden Files</i> is all the stories I come up with that are too small or too straightforward to write into a novel. One of the great pleasures I've had as a writer is getting the opportunity to tell some of those stories in a short-story format, and in graphic novels like this one! <i>War Cry</i> is one of the stories I always wanted to tell but never got the chance to in the context of the novels, and I'm extremely pleased with how well it's coming out."<br><br></p><p></p><h2>Havana Gold: The Havana Quartet (Mario Conde Investigates)</h2><p><p>Praise for the <i>Havana Quartet</i>:</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Havana Red</i>, another winner from Bitter Lemon Press.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Overlaid with a rich smoky patina, an atmosphere that reeks of slums and riches, cigar smoke and exotic perfumes.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Independent</i></p><p>&#x201c;Talk about unexpected discoveries, the <i>Havana Quartet</i> is a revelation.

He is a prize winning novelist, essayist, journalist and scriptwriter. International fame came with the publication of the Havana Quartet, all featuring Lieutenant Mario Conde, of which Havana Black is the second to be available in English.The Quartet has been translated into seven languages and has won numerous prizes including Spain's Hammett Prize.

Padura is most famous for his Inspector Mario Conde novels, all published in English by Bitter Lemon Press.<br><br>Mario Conde, Padura's tormented Cuban police detective, is at his anguished best in this sequentially second volume of the so-called Havana Quartet, which constitutes a four-season chronicle of one year (1989) in Conde's life, though it's the last of the four to be available in English translation. The hard-drinking, romantic Conde, who's wanted to become a writer but ended up as a policeman in a corrupt and struggling land, constantly questions his fate as he investigates the murder of young, good-looking school teacher, Lissette N��ez Delgado, who taught at Pre-University High School, the same school Conde attended in his youth. Conde's return to his old school triggers nostalgia and regrets as he interviews the headmaster, students and fellow teachers. The original title, <i>Vientos de Cuaresma</i> (<i>The Winds of Lent</i>), captures the extensive wind imagery that Padura skillfully uses to capture Conde's state of mind. <i>(June 30)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ten is the book&#x2019;s protagonist (the rules are his). He has a cat named Tank, an ex-girlfriend he calls "she-who-hates-cats", and he often chooses a cold beer instead of meditation to reduce stress. His spiritual insights run as a sub-theme in his mind, as he chases bad guys and looks for clues. He models himself after Sherlock Holmes (his childhood idol) and has a Dr. Watson style computer-jockey sidekick named Mike. The action begins when a casual visitor to Ten&#x2019;s residence turns up dead. Just days after leaving the LAPD, Ten becomes immersed in unraveling the crime and adjusting to being an outsider to his former law-enforcement family. Subtly laced with drugs, sex, and ex-rockers, in addition to a compassionately rendered supporting cast, this one is a page turner with a broad potential audience.

Yet, never before has anyone published a collection of interviews that Warhol himself gave. I&#39;ll Be Your Mirror contains more then thirty conversations revealing this unique and important artist. Each piece presents a different facet of the Sphinx-like Warhol&#39;s ever-evolving personality. Writer Kenneth Goldsmith provides context and provenance for each selection. Beginning in 1962 with a notorious interview in which Warhol literally begs the interviewer to put words into his mouth, the book covers Warhol&#39;s most important artistic period during the &#39;60s. As Warhol shifts to filmmaking in the &#39;70s, this collection explores his emergence as socialite, scene-maker, and trendsetter; his influential Interview magazine; and the Studio 54 scene. In the 80s, his support of young artists like Jean-Michel Basquait, his perspective on art history and the growing relationship to technology in his work are shown. Finally, his return to religious imagery and spirituality are available in an interview conducted just months before his death. Including photographs and previous unpublished interviews, this collage of Warhol showcases the artist&#39;s ability to manipulate, captivate, and enrich American culture.</p><p>Kenneth Goldsmith&#39;s writing has been called some of the most &#34;exhaustive and beautiful collage work yet produced in poetry&#34; by Publishers Weekly. The author of seven books and editor of the online journal UbuWeb, Goldsmith is also a music writer for New York Press and host of weekly radio show on New York City&#39;s WFMU. He lives in New York City."I always feel that my words are coming from behind me, not from me"&#x2014;this expertly chosen and edited first collection of interviews with inarguably the most influential artist of his and our time shows that for Warhol (1928&#x2013;1987) the interview was an art form like any other. Again and again, with a variety of interlocutors ranging from the innocent to the fake (as when poet Gerard Malanga asks deliberately loaded questions) to the actively hostile, Warhol expertly controls the situation. But Warhol's judolike feints, in which questioners, tipped over by the weight of their preconceptions, are left clutching at thin air, are less about concealing anything than they are about adding intrigue and tension&#x2014;entertainment value, if you will&#x2014;to an inherently absurd and artificial situation. Goldsmith, a conceptual artist, poet and radio host, contributes vividly written general and individual introductions that set up each piece perfectly. In gathering this book, he has performed a service not only for Warhol scholars but for anyone interested in the bewildering transformations of American culture, where "everyone and everything is interesting." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And the possessive love of their mother, Zana, stirs the troubled waters between them even more. After a brutally violent exchange between the young boys, Yaqub, &#x201c;the good son,&#x201d; is sent from his home in Brazil to live with relatives in Lebanon, only to return five years later as a virtual stranger to the parents who bore him, his tensions with Omar unchanged. Family secrets engage the reader in this profoundly resonant story about identity, love, loss, deception, and the dissolution of blood ties.<br><br> Set in the port city of Manaus on the riverbanks of the Amazon, <i>Two Brothers</i> celebrates the vibrant life and diversity of Brazil. Based on a work by acclaimed novelist Milton Hatoum, <i>Two Brothers</i> is stunningly reimagined by the award-winning graphic novelists F�bio Moon and Gabriel B�.<br><br>"This work goes far beyond its publicity hook, which is that Eisner award&#x2013;winning Brazilian twin brothers (<i>Casanova, Daytripper</i>) have adapted Milton Hatoum&#x2019;s classic novel about twin brothers to the graphic novel form. Narrated mostly by Nael, the illegitimate son of one of the brothers, the tale is presented in a nonlinear narrative with multiple flashbacks, as stories within stories begin to fill in the greater family chronicle spiraling around the twins and their simmering rivalry and hatred. The intricate secrets and lies at the heart of families are set against a backdrop of almost cinematic cityscapes and vistas. B� and Moon present the naturalistic dynamism of Brazil in their art: sweeping, dramatic organic shapes against the sharp angularity of the people. The stark b&amp;w art crackles to express the subtleties of palpable, barely contained tension between kin, a brutal police beating, and the erotic electricity of an exotic dance. B� and Moon bring a cool, confident sharpness to their narrative to reflect the shades of gray in this powerful family saga."<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly&nbsp;</i>(Starred &nbsp;review)<br>&#x201c;TWO BROTHERS is a feat of bravura visual storytelling, a revealing and nuanced work of family portraiture, and a thrilling act of historical re-imagination.

It is most amazing to be alive in a time where two creators such as these exist - they give us another reason to wake up and another way to see the world. Two Brothers, like their other work, is another masterpiece, but so different in it&#x2019;s pacing and tone than anything they have done before.

Attention to detail, the concern with communicating with the reader on emotional terms as well as intellectual, it is a classic example that artistic chops still matter in the modern comics world. In fact it matters more than ever now.<br>&#x2014;Gilbert Hernandez, <i>LOVE &amp; ROCKETS</i><br> &#x201c;Moon and B� have both shot for the stars here...

They are Brazil&#39;s very own WONDER TWINS."The creative chemistry of the cartoonists is as strong as the rivalry between the brothers at the heart of Hatoum&#x2019;s story, and their sincere reverence for the source material enriches the narrative as it&#x2019;s translated to a visual medium.

Here, 16 scholars set delve into the heart of Pink Floyd by examining ideas, concepts, and problems usually encountered not in a rock band's lyrics but in the pages of Heidegger, Foucault, and Sartre. These include the meaning of existence, the individual's place in society, the contradictions of art and commerce, and the blurry line between genius and madness.

Mike also pastored churches during that period. About twenty-two years ago, Mike and his wife Debi moved to rural Tennessee where they continued in the work by holding Bible studies in local homes, which eventually led to regular meetings of the local body of believers, and the starting of the prison ministry where Mike still ministers every Saturday.

He is all alone in the plane, which will shortly reach <em>terminal velocity</em> and crash into the vast Australian outback. Before it does, he will unfold the tale of his journey from an obedient Creedish child and humble domestic servant to an ultra-buffed, steroid- and collagen-packed media messiah, author of a best-selling autobiography, <em>Saved from Salvation</em>, and the even better selling <em>Book of Very Common Prayer</em> (The Prayer to Delay Orgasm, The Prayer to Prevent Hair Loss, The Prayer to Silence Car Alarms). He'll even share his insight that "the only difference between suicide and martyrdom is press coverage," and deny responsibility for the Tender Branson Sensitive Materials Landfill &#x2015; a 20,000-acre repository for the nation's outdated pornography. Among other matters both bizarre and trenchant.<br><br> Not since Kurt Vonnegut's <em>Mother Night</em> and Jerzy Kosinski's <em>Being There</em> has there been as black and telling a satire on the wages of fame and the bedrock lunacy of the modern world. Survivor is Chuck Palahniuk at his deadpan peak, and it marks him as a blazing talent for the new millennium.</p><p>Some say that the apocalypse swiftly approacheth, but that simply ain't so according to Chuck Palahniuk. Oh no. It's already here, living in the head of the guy who just crossed the street in front of you, or maybe even closer than that. We saw these possibilities get played out in the author's bloodsporting-anarchist-yuppie shocker of a first novel, <i>Fight Club</i>. Now, in <i>Survivor</i>, his second and newest, the concern is more for the origin of the malaise. Starting at chapter 47 and screaming toward ground zero, Palahniuk hurls the reader back to the beginning in a breathless search for where it all went wrong. This time out, the author's protagonist is self-made, self-ruined mogul-messiah Tender Branson, the sole passenger of a jet moments away from slamming first into the Australian outback and then into oblivion. All that will be left, Branson assures us with a tone bordering on relief, is his life story, from its Amish-on-acid cult beginnings to its televangelist-huckster end. All of this courtesy of the plane's flight recorder.<p> Speaking of little black boxes, Skinnerians would have a field day with the presenting behavior of the folks who make up Palahniuk's world. They pretend they're suicide hotline operators for fun. They eat lobster before it's quite... done. They dance in morgues. The Cleavers they are not. Scary as they might be, these characters are ultimately more scared of themselves than you are, and that's what makes them so fascinating. In the wee hours and on lonely highways, they exist in a perpetual twilight, caught between the horror of the present and the dread of the unknown. With only two novels under his belt, Chuck Palahniuk is well on his way to becoming an expert at shining a light on these shadowy creatures. <i>--Bob Michaels</i></p>From the author of the cult sensation <b>Fight Club</b> (now a major motion picture starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter) comes <b>Survivor</b>.<br><br>"A turbo-charged, deliciously manic satire of contemporary American life." --<i>Newsday</i><br><br>"The only difference between suicide and martyrdom is press coverage," according to the "been there, done that" wisdom of Tender Branson, last surviving member of the Creedish Death Cult.

These vignettes are known as <i>gongan</i> in Chinese and <i>koan</i> in Japanese. <br><br> <i>Secrets of the Blue Cliff Record </i>is a fresh translation featuring newly translated commentary from two of the greatest Zen masters of early modern Japan, Hakuin Ekaku (1685&#x2013;1768) of the Rinzai sect of Zen and Tenkei Denson (1648&#x2013;1735) of the Soto sect of Zen. This translation and commentary on <i>The Blue Cliff Record </i> sheds new light on the meaning of this central Zen text.</p><p>The Blue Cliff Record is a collection of Chinese koan, cryptic Zen stories that point the way to enlightenment. Monks would (and still do) spend days, months, even years on a single koan, ruminating over it, plumbing its depths--not trying to figure it out, but letting it open a door inside of them. Over the centuries, masters have attempted to help the process along by adding their own remarks. Translator Thomas Cleary tells us that two of the most important commentators on the Blue Cliff Record have been the Japanese Hakuin Ekaku of the Rinzai lineage and Tenkei Denson of the Soto. In <i>Secrets of the Blue Cliff Record</i>, Cleary includes the core elements of the original Blue Cliff Record and selections from the extensive work of these two commentators. The result is not exactly a CliffsNotes, as the reading is still arduous. Even the comments can be cryptic and in need of comment.
